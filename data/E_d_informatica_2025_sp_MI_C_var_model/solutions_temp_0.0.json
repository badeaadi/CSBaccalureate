The expression is:\n```cpp\n!(x<2004) && !(x<2005 || x>2024) && !(x>2025)\n```\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Analyze each part of the expression:\n   - `!(x<2004)` implies `x >= 2004`.\n   - `!(x<2005 || x>2024)` implies `x >= 2005` and `x <= 2024`.\n   - `!(x>2025)` implies `x <= 2025`.\n2. Combine these conditions:\n   - From `x >= 2004` and `x >= 2005`, the effective lower bound is `x >= 2005`.\n   - From `x <= 2024` and `x <= 2025`, the effective upper bound is `x <= 2024`.\n3.

We need to determine the value of `f(2,5)`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Start with `f(2,5)`. Since `n > 0`, it calls `f(f(0,5)-2,0)`.\n2. Evaluate `f(0,5)`, which returns `5` because `n <= 0`.\n3. Substitute back: `f(5-2,0)` becomes `f(3,0)`.\n4. Evaluate `f(3,0)`. Since `n > 0`, it calls `f(f(1,0)-2,-5)`.\n5. Evaluate `f(1,0)`, which calls `f(f(-1,0)-2,-5)`. Since `n <= 0`, `f(-1,0)` returns `0`.\n6. Substitute back: `f(0-2,-5)` becomes `f(-2,-5)`, which returns `-5`.\n7. Substitute back: `f(-5-2,-5)` becomes `f(-7,-5)`, which returns `-5`.\n\n### Answer\nd. -5\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nThe code performs a series of character swaps on the string \"ROMANIA\". We need to determine the final string.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Initialize `s` with \"ROMANIA\", `i` with `6` (length of \"ROMANIA\" - 1), and `j` with `3`.\n2. Perform swaps in the loop:\n   - Swap `s[6]` with `s[3]`: \"ROMANAI\"\n   - Swap `s[3]` with `s[0]`: \"IAMARON\"\n   - Swap `s[0]` with `s[-3]` (out of bounds, stop here)\n3.

An elementary circuit is a closed path where no vertex is repeated except for the starting and ending vertex.\n2. Analyze the graph:\n   - Start from vertex 1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 forms a circuit.\n3. This path is elementary as it does not repeat any vertex other than the start/end.\n\n### Answer\nb. 1,2,3,1\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the number of nodes in a complete undirected graph with 300 edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. The formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with `n` nodes is `n(n-1)/2 = 300`.\n2. Solve for `n`:\n   - `n(n-1) = 600`\n   - `n^2 - n - 600 = 0`\n   - Solve the quadratic equation: `n = (1 ± sqrt(1 + 2400))/2`\n   - `n = (1 ± 49)/2`\n   - `n = 25` (since `n` must be positive)\n\n### Answer\na. 25\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the output of a pseudocode algorithm and provide equivalent C++ code and pseudocode with a different loop structure.\n\n### Solution Approach\na. **Calculate the output for inputs 15, 3, 4:**\n   - Loop from 15 to 1, check conditions for each `i`.\n   - Count numbers divisible by `3` but not `4`, or divisible by `4` but not `3`.\n   - Result: `10` numbers meet the criteria.\n\nb. **Find two input sets for output 0:**\n   - If `x` and `y` are such that no number in the range is divisible by one and not the other, the result is `0`.\n   - Example sets: `(1, 1, 1)` and `(2, 2, 2)`.\n\nc. **C++ Code:**\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, x, y, nr = 0;\n    cin >> n >> x >> y;\n    for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {\n        if ((i % x == 0 && i % y != 0) || (i % x != 0 && i % y == 0)) {\n            nr++;\n        }\n    }\n    cout << nr << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd. **Pseudocode with initial test loop:**\n```\nread n, x, y\nnr <- 0\ni <- n\nwhile i >= 1 do\n    if (i % x = 0 and i % y ≠ 0) or (i % x ≠ 0 and i % y = 0) then\n        nr <- nr + 1\n    end if\n    i <- i - 1\nend while\nwrite nr\n```\n\n### Answer\na. 10  \nb.

We need to analyze the logical expression and simplify it to determine the bounds on `x`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. **Analyze the negations:**  `!(x < 2004)` means `x >= 2004`.  `!(x > 2025)` means `x <= 2025`.\n2. **Analyze the OR condition:** `!(x < 2005 || x > 2024)` means `x >= 2005 && x <= 2024`.  The negation of an OR is the AND of the negations.\n3. **Combine the conditions:** The overall expression is `(x >= 2004) && (x >= 2005 && x <= 2024) && (x <= 2025)`.\n4. **Simplify:** The intersection of these conditions is `x >= 2005 && x <= 2024`.\n\n### Answer\nThe interval is [2005, 2024].

Call `f(f(2-2, 5) - 2, 5 - 5)`.\n2. **f(0, 5):** `n > 0` is false. Return `x`, which is 5.\n3. **Back to f(2, 5):**  We now have `f(5 - 2, 0)`, which is `f(3, 0)`.\n4. **f(3, 0):** `n > 0` is true. Call `f(f(3-2, 0) - 2, 0 - 5)`.\n5. **f(1, 0):** `n > 0` is true. Call `f(f(1-2, 0) - 2, 0 - 5)`.\n6. **f(-1, 0):** `n > 0` is false. Return `x`, which is 0.\n7. **Back to f(1, 0):** We now have `f(0 - 2, -5)`, which is `f(-2, -5)`.\n8. **f(-2, -5):** `n > 0` is false.

Read the year `x` from the first line.\n2. Read the car codes from the second line one by one.\n3. Extract the year from each code.\n4. Keep track of the last two cars found with the matching year.\n5. If two consecutive cars are found, store their collector identifiers.\n6. After reading all codes, print the stored identifiers or \"nu exista\".\n\n### a. Algorithm Description (Natural Language)\n\nThe algorithm reads the target year `x` first. Then, it iterates through the car codes in the file. For each code, it extracts the manufacturing year. It maintains two variables, `lastCollector` and `secondLastCollector`, to store the identifiers of the collectors of the last two cars found with the target year.  If a car's year matches `x`, the algorithm updates `secondLastCollector` with the value of `lastCollector` and `lastCollector` with the current car's collector identifier.  After processing all codes, if both `lastCollector` and `secondLastCollector` have been assigned (meaning at least two cars with year `x` were found), it checks if the last two cars were consecutive. This is implicitly checked because we update `secondLastCollector` only when we find a new match. Finally, it prints the two collector identifiers or the \"nu exista\" message. This algorithm is efficient because it reads the file only once (O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of car codes) and uses a constant amount of extra memory (O(1) space complexity).\n\n### b.

C++ implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x, code;\n    fin >> x;\n    \n    int lastId = -1, prevLastId = -1;\n    bool foundConsecutive = false;\n    int prevYear = -1;\n    \n    while (fin >> code) {\n        // Extract year (last 4 digits)\n        int year = code % 10000;\n        // Extract collector ID (remaining digits)\n        int id = code / 10000;\n        \n        if (year == x) {\n            if (prevYear == x) {\n                // Found two consecutive cars from year x\n                prevLastId = lastId;\n                lastId = id;\n                foundConsecutive = true;\n            } else {\n                // Found first car from year x\n                lastId = id;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        prevYear = year;\n    }\n    \n    if (foundConsecutive) {\n        cout << prevLastId << \" \" << lastId;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWait, I need to correct my solution. The problem asks for the last two consecutive cars that were both manufactured in year x and are consecutive in the exhibition. My solution doesn't correctly track this.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x, code;\n    fin >> x;\n    \n    int prevId = -1, prevYear = -1;\n    int lastId1 = -1, lastId2 = -1;\n    \n    while (fin >> code) {\n        int year = code % 10000;\n        int id = code / 10000;\n        \n        if (year == x && prevYear == x) {\n            // Found two consecutive cars from year x\n            lastId1 = prevId;\n            lastId2 = id;\n        }\n        \n        prevId = id;\n        prevYear = year;\n    }\n    \n    if (lastId1 != -1) {\n        cout << lastId1 << \" \" << lastId2;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Answer\na.
