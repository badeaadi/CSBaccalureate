We need to determine the result of `f(2,5)`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- Start with `f(2,5)`.\n- Since `n > 0`, call `f(f(0,5)-2,0)`.\n- `f(0,5)` returns `5` because `n <= 0`.\n- Thus, `f(5-2,0)` becomes `f(3,0)`.\n- Continue recursively: `f(f(1,0)-2,-5)`.\n- `f(1,0)` becomes `f(f(-1,0)-2,-5)`, and `f(-1,0)` returns `0`.\n- So, `f(0-2,-5)` becomes `f(-2,-5)` which returns `-5`.\n\n### Answer\nd. -5\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nThe code modifies the string `s` by swapping characters based on the loop conditions. We need to determine the final string.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- Start with `s = \"ROMANIA\"`.\n- `i = strlen(s) - 1 = 6`, `j = 3`.\n- The loop swaps characters at positions `i` and `i-j`.\n- Perform swaps until `j >= 0`.\n\nStep-by-step swaps:\n1. Swap `s[6]` and `s[3]`: \"ROMANAA\"\n2. Swap `s[3]` and `s[0]`: \"AOMRNAA\"\n3. Swap `s[0]` and `s[0]`: \"AROMNAA\"\n\nFinal string is \"ARMONIA\".\n\n### Answer\na.

The expression involves negations and logical AND/OR operators. We need to simplify the expression and determine the bounds on `x`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. **Simplify the negations:**  `!(x < 2004)` is equivalent to `x >= 2004`.  `!(x < 2005 || x > 2024)` is equivalent to `x >= 2005 && x <= 2024`. `!(x > 2025)` is equivalent to `x <= 2025`.\n2. **Combine the simplified expressions:** The entire expression becomes `x >= 2004 && (x >= 2005 && x <= 2024) && x <= 2025`.\n3. **Find the intersection of the intervals:**\n    * `x >= 2004`\n    * `x >= 2005 && x <= 2024`  => `[2005, 2024]`\n    * `x <= 2025`\n    The intersection of all three conditions is `[2005, 2024]`.\n\n### Answer\nc.

The sixth solution is 1302.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a C++ structure named `epoca` to store information about a vintage car: year of manufacture, and the day and month of its last exhibition.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Nested Structure:** We'll use a nested structure to represent the exhibition date.\n2.  **Data Types:**\n    *   `anFabricatie`: `int`\n    *   `expo.zi`: `int`\n    *   `expo.luna`: `char[16]` (to accommodate strings up to 15 characters + null terminator)\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n\nstruct DataExpozitie {\n    int zi;\n    char luna[16];\n};\n\nstruct epoca {\n    int anFabricatie;\n    DataExpozitie expo;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    epoca m;\n\n    // Example usage (you would normally read these from input)\n    m.anFabricatie = 1930;\n    m.expo.zi = 15;\n    strcpy(m.expo.luna, \"iulie\");\n\n    std::cout << \"An fabricatie: \" << m.anFabricatie << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Zi expozitie: \" << m.expo.zi << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Luna expozitie: \" << m.expo.luna << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe `pao` subprogram checks if two numbers are \"par-oglindite\" (mirror-like after removing non-even digits).\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Extract Even Digits:** Create two helper functions or inline logic to extract even digits from `x` and `y` and form new numbers.\n2.  **Reverse Numbers:** Create a function to reverse a number.\n3.  **Compare Reversed Numbers:** Compare the reversed numbers formed from the even digits.\n4.  **Return Value:** Return 1 if the reversed numbers are equal, 0 otherwise.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nlong long extractEvenDigits(long long n) {\n    long long evenNum = 0;\n    long long powerOf10 = 1;\n    while (n > 0) {\n        int digit = n % 10;\n        if (digit % 2 == 0) {\n            evenNum += digit * powerOf10;\n            powerOf10 *= 10;\n        }\n        n /= 10;\n    }\n    return evenNum;\n}\n\nlong long reverseNumber(long long n) {\n    long long reversed = 0;\n    while (n > 0) {\n        reversed = reversed * 10 + n % 10;\n        n /= 10;\n    }\n    return reversed;\n}\n\nvoid pao(long long x, long long y, int& rez) {\n    long long evenX = extractEvenDigits(x);\n    long long evenY = extractEvenDigits(y);\n\n    long long reversedEvenX = reverseNumber(evenX);\n    long long reversedEvenY = reverseNumber(evenY);\n\n    if (reversedEvenX == reversedEvenY) {\n        rez = 1;\n    } else {\n        rez = 0;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    long long x, y;\n    int rez;\n\n    x = 814;\n    y = 7003485;\n    pao(x, y, rez);\n    std::cout << rez << std::endl; // Output: 1\n\n    x = 14;\n    y = 700345;\n    pao(x, y, rez);\n    std::cout << rez << std::endl; // Output: 1\n\n    x = 814;\n    y = 7003465;\n    pao(x, y, rez);\n    std::cout << rez << std::endl; // Output: 0\n\n    x = 814;\n    y = 7003845;\n    pao(x, y, rez);\n    std::cout << rez << std::endl; // Output: 0\n\n    x = 15;\n    y = 510;\n    pao(x,y,rez);\n    std::cout << rez << std::endl; //Output: 0\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to create an `n x n` matrix where the main diagonal contains the first `n` multiples of `k` in ascending order, and each row contains consecutive numbers in descending order.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Diagonal:** Fill the diagonal elements `matrix[i][i]` with `(i + 1) * k`.\n2.  **Rows:** For each row `i`, fill the elements from right to left, starting from `matrix[i][i]` and decrementing by 1 for each subsequent element.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int k, n;\n    std::cin >> k >> n;\n\n    int matrix[102][102]; // Assuming maximum size is 102x102\n\n    // Fill the diagonal\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        matrix[i][i] = (i + 1) * k;\n    }\n\n    // Fill the rows\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; --j) {\n            matrix[i][j] = matrix[i][j + 1] + 1;\n        }\n        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {\n            matrix[i][j] = matrix[i][j - 1] - 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the matrix\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\n            std::cout << matrix[i][j] << \" \";\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the identifiers of the collectors who own the last two consecutive cars manufactured in a given year `x`. The car codes are in the format (collector ID)(year).\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Read Input:** Read `x` from the first line.  Read the car codes from the second line one by one.\n2.  **Extract Year and ID:** For each car code, extract the year (last four digits) and the collector ID (remaining digits).\n3.  **Track Last Two Cars:** Keep track of the last two cars that match the year `x`.\n4.  **Efficiency:**\n    *   **Memory:** We only store the last two matching car codes and their IDs, not the entire list.\n    *   **Time:** We iterate through the input only once.\n\n### Answer\n**(a) Algorithm Description (Natural Language):**\n\n1.  Read the target year `x` from the first line of the file.\n2.  Initialize two variables, `last_id` and `second_to_last_id`, to store the collector IDs of the last two cars manufactured in year `x`. Initialize them to -1 (or any invalid ID) to indicate that we haven't found any matching cars yet.\n3.  Read the car codes from the second line of the file one by one.\n4.  For each car code:\n    *   Extract the year of manufacture by taking the remainder of the code divided by 10000.\n    *   Extract the collector ID by dividing the code by 10000.\n    *   If the extracted year is equal to `x`:\n        *   Update `second_to_last_id` with the value of `last_id`.\n        *   Update `last_id` with the current collector ID.\n5.  After reading all car codes, check if both `last_id` and `second_to_last_id` have been updated (i.e., are not -1).\n    *   If they have been updated, print `second_to_last_id` and `last_id` separated by a space.\n    *   Otherwise, print \"nu exista\".\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because it uses a constant amount of memory (only a few variables) regardless of the number of car codes in the input file. It also processes the input file in a single pass, making its time complexity linear, O(N), where N is the number of car codes.\n\n**(b) C++ Code:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream file(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x;\n    file >> x;\n\n    long long code;\n    int last_id = -1;\n    int second_to_last_id = -1;\n\n    while (file >> code) {\n        int year = code % 10000;\n        int collector_id = code / 10000;\n\n        if (year == x) {\n            second_to_last_id = last_id;\n            last_id = collector_id;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (last_id != -1 && second_to_last_id != -1) {\n        std::cout << second_to_last_id << \" \" << last_id << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    file.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

Read the year x and the codes of the cars\n2. Process the codes one by one, extracting the collector ID and manufacturing year\n3. Keep track of consecutive cars from year x\n4. Print the collector IDs of the last two consecutive cars from year x\n\n### Algorithm Description (Efficient)\n1. Read the year x from the first line\n2. Initialize variables to track consecutive cars and their collector IDs\n3. Process each car code:\n   - Extract the manufacturing year (last 4 digits)\n   - Extract the collector ID (remaining digits)\n   - If the year matches x, update our tracking variables\n4. After processing all codes, check if we found two consecutive cars and output accordingly\n\nThe algorithm is efficient because:\n- It uses O(1) extra memory (constant space)\n- It processes each car code exactly once (linear time)\n- It doesn't need to store all car codes in memory\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    \n    int x;\n    fin >> x;\n    \n    int lastId = -1, prevLastId = -1;\n    bool foundConsecutive = false;\n    int code, prevCode = 0;\n    \n    while (fin >> code) {\n        int year = code % 10000;  // Extract year (last 4 digits)\n        int id = code / 10000;    // Extract collector ID\n        \n        if (year == x) {\n            if (prevCode != 0 && year == prevCode % 10000) {\n                // Found consecutive cars from year x\n                prevLastId = lastId;\n                lastId = id;\n                foundConsecutive = true;\n            } else {\n                // Reset sequence\n                prevLastId = -1;\n                lastId = id;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        prevCode = code;\n    }\n    \n    if (foundConsecutive) {\n        cout << prevLastId << \" \" << lastId;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWait, I need to correct my solution for Exercise III-3.
