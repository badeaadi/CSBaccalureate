The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe maximum remainder when dividing by a number `n` is `n-1`. This occurs when the dividend is one less than a multiple of `n`.  Since x can be any value less than 10^9, we can always find a value close enough to get the maximum remainder.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of `x % 2024` is 2024 - 1 = 2023.  The correct answer is **c. 2023**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given three functions, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, and we need to determine which of them produce the same result when called with n = 24.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each function for n = 24:\n\n*   **f1(24):**  `24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 24 * 25 / 2 = 12 * 25 = 300`\n*   **f2(24):** This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.  It's equivalent to f1. `f2(24) = 24 + 23 + ... + 1 = 24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 300`\n*   **f3(24):**\n    *   `f3(24) = 24 * 24 / 4 + 2 * f3(12) = 144 + 2 * f3(12)`\n    *   `f3(12) = 12 * 12 / 4 + 2 * f3(6) = 36 + 2 * f3(6)`\n    *   `f3(6) = 6 * 6 / 4 + 2 * f3(3) = 9 + 2 * f3(3)`\n    *   `f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + (2*2/4 + 2*f3(1)) = 3 + 1 + 2*(1+f3(0)) = 4 + 2 * 1 = 6`\n    *   `f3(6) = 9 + 2 * 6 = 9 + 12 = 21`\n    *   `f3(12) = 36 + 2 * 21 = 36 + 42 = 78`\n    *   `f3(24) = 144 + 2 * 78 = 144 + 156 = 300`\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions, f1, f2, and f3, return the same value (300) when called with n = 24. The correct answer is **d. f1, f2 și f3**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the 7th combination of ingredients generated using backtracking, following specific rules:\n1.  Conopida (cauliflower) and broccoli cannot be in the same dish. If either is present, it's the first ingredient.\n2.  Patrunjel (parsley), if present, is the last ingredient.\n3.  If smantana (sour cream) and cascaval (cheese) are together, smantana comes before cascaval.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll list the combinations following the rules, building upon the given first five:\n\n1.  (broccoli, cascaval, ou, patrunjel)\n2.  (broccoli, ou, cascaval, patrunjel)\n3.  (broccoli, ou, smantana, cascaval)\n4.  (broccoli, ou, smantana, patrunjel)\n5.  (broccoli, smantana, cascaval, ou)\n6.  (broccoli, smantana, cascaval, patrunjel)\n7.  (broccoli, smantana, ou, cascaval)\n\n### Answer\nThe seventh generated combination is (broccoli, smantana, ou, cascaval). The correct answer is **a. (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nGiven a parent vector representing a tree, we need to count the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA leaf node is a node that doesn't have any children. In the parent vector representation, a node `i` is *not* a leaf if its value appears in the parent vector.  We can iterate through the parent vector and mark the nodes that are parents. Then, we count the nodes that are not marked.\n\n### Answer\nThe parent vector is (7, 4, 6, 7, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5). The root is node 7 (parent 0).\nThe parents are: 7, 4, 6, 9, 5.\nThe nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\nLeaf nodes are those that do not appear in the parent array: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10.\nThere are 5 leaf nodes. The correct answer is **b. 5**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets, one connected to all others. We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional transport bands to add to make the graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have even degrees. Initially, one market (let's call it A) has degree 4, and the other four markets (B, C, D, E) have degree 1.  To make the graph Eulerian, we need to make the degrees of B, C, D, and E even. We can achieve this by adding edges between them.  We can add an edge between B and C, and another between D and E. This increases the degree of each of B, C, D, and E to 2.\n\n### Answer\nWe need to add 2 edges. The correct answer is **b. 2**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm reads `n` numbers. For each number `x`, it removes digits from the right as long as the last digit is less than or equal to the second-to-last digit.  It sums the resulting `x` values into `m`. Finally, it prints `m` if `m` is not equal to `n`, and \"egal\" otherwise.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will follow the algorithm step by step for each part.\n\n**(a)**\n\n*   n = 4\n*   m = 0\n*   **i = 4, x = 721:**  721 -> 72 (1 <= 2) -> 7 (2 <= 7). m = 0 + 7 = 7\n*   **i = 3, x = 20020:** 20020 -> 2002 (0 <= 2) -> 200 (2 <= 0 is false). m = 7 + 200 = 207\n*   **i = 2, x = 1321:** 1321 -> 132 (1 <= 2) -> 13 (2 <= 3) -> 1 (3 <= 1 is false). m = 207 + 1 = 208\n*   **i = 1, x = 211:** 211 -> 21 (1 <= 1) -> 2 (1 <= 2). m = 208 + 2 = 210\n*   m (210) != n (4), so the output is 210.\n\n**(b)**\n\n*   n = 2\n*   We need to find distinct numbers in [10, 10000] such that their sum after the digit removal process is 2.\n*   The only numbers that can result in 1 after the process are numbers like 1, 11, 111, 1111, etc, and numbers that will eventually reduce to 1.\n*   The only numbers that can result in 2 are 2, 22, 222, 2222, etc.\n*   Since the numbers must be distinct and from the interval [10, 10^4], we can choose 11 (which becomes 1) and 2x (becomes 2) where x can be any digit.\n*   So, we can choose 11 and 22.\n\n**(c)**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    m = 0;\n    i = n;\n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    if (m != n) {\n        cout << m;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**(d)**\n\n```pseudocode\ncitește n (număr natural nenul)\nm <- 0\npentru i <- n, 1, -1 execută\n    citește x (număr natural)\n    cât timp x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 execută\n        x <- [x/10]\n    sfârșit cât timp\n    m <- m + x\nsfârșit pentru\ndacă m ≠ n atunci\n    scrie m\naltfel\n    scrie „egal”\nsfârșit dacă\n```\n\n### Answer\n**(a)** 210\n**(b)** 11, 22 (or other valid combinations such as 19, 20)\n**(c)** See C++ code above.\n**(d)** See pseudocode above.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a structure named `telefon` to store information about a phone: producer (a single character), processor frequency (integer), and dimensions (width, thickness, length - all floats).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll use the `struct` keyword to define the structure, including the specified members and their data types.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3]; // Or: float latime, grosime, lungime;\n};\n\ntelefon t;\n```\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 2D array `a` with 4 rows and 24 columns. We need to print the indices of the columns where the first and last elements are both 2024.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll iterate through the columns (from 0 to 23). For each column, we'll check if `a[0][i]` and `a[3][i]` are both equal to 2024. If they are, we print the column index `i`.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  int a[4][24]; // Assuming the array is declared and initialized elsewhere\n  // Example initialization (replace with your actual array data)\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)\n        for(int j = 0; j < 24; ++j)\n            a[i][j] = 0; // Initialize to 0, for example\n  a[0][2] = 2024;\n  a[3][2] = 2024;\n  a[0][5] = 2024;\n  a[3][5] = 2024;\n  a[0][10] = 2024;\n  a[3][10] = 2000;\n\n  for (int i = 0; i < 24; i++) {\n    if (a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024) {\n      cout << i << \" \";\n    }\n  }\n  cout << endl;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe `produs` subprogram takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the product of their common divisors.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll iterate from 1 up to the minimum of `a` and `b`. For each number, we check if it divides both `a` and `b`. If it does, we multiply it into a running product.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm> // For std::min\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint produs(int a, int b) {\n    int p = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= min(a, b); ++i) {\n        if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {\n            p *= i;\n        }\n    }\n    return p;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cout << produs(20, 12) << endl; // Output: 8\n    cout << produs(15,25) << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe read an integer `n` and a text. We need to print words shorter than `n` on one line and words longer than `n` on another line. If either set is empty, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll read the text word by word. We'll use two strings to accumulate the words for each category (shorter than n, and longer than n). After reading all words, we'll print the accumulated strings or \"nu exista\" if a string is empty.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <sstream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    cin.ignore(); // Consume the newline after reading n\n\n    string text;\n    getline(cin, text);\n\n    string shorter, longer;\n    stringstream ss(text);\n    string word;\n\n    while (ss >> word) {\n        if (word.length() < n) {\n            shorter += word + \" \";\n        } else if (word.length() > n) {\n            longer += word + \" \";\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (shorter.empty()) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << shorter << endl;\n    }\n\n    if (longer.empty()) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << longer << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given the number of winners for each prize (I, II, III) and a list of book prices. We need to find the highest prices for each prize such that the prices are strictly decreasing and there are enough books at each price.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Count Frequencies:** Read the book prices and store the frequency of each price in a `map` or array.\n2.  **Iterate and Find Prices:** Iterate through the possible prices in descending order.\n    *   For prize I, find the highest price with at least `n1` books.\n    *   For prize II, find the highest price (lower than prize I's price) with at least `n2` books.\n    *   For prize III, find the highest price (lower than prize II's price) with at least `n3` books.\n3.  **Output:** If all three prices are found, print them. Otherwise, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Answer\n\n**(a) Algorithm Description and Justification**\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Read `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and the book prices.\n2.  **Frequency Counting:** Create a frequency map (or array) to store the count of each book price. This is efficient because we only need to iterate through the prices once.\n3.  **Find Prices (Descending Order):**  Iterate through the *distinct* prices in descending order. This ensures we find the highest possible prices for each prize.\n    *   Check if there are enough books (count >= n1, n2, or n3) for the current price.\n    *   If enough books are found, assign the price to the corresponding prize and decrement the counts in the frequency map.\n4.  **Output:** Print the three prices if found, or \"nu exista\" otherwise.\n\nThis algorithm is efficient in terms of time complexity because:\n\n*   **Frequency Counting:**  Reading the prices and counting frequencies takes O(N) time, where N is the number of prices.\n*   **Finding Prices:** Iterating through distinct prices in descending order is at most O(M), where M is number of distinct prices (M <= 1000 - 10 + 1 = 991, because of the range [10, 1000]). In the worst case, this is much smaller than N.\n*   Overall, the time complexity is dominated by O(N), making it efficient for large input sizes. We avoid sorting the entire price list, which would take O(N log N) time.\n\n**(b) C++ Code**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <map>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n1, n2, n3;\n    cin >> n1 >> n2 >> n3;\n\n    map<int, int> freq;\n    int price;\n    while (cin >> price) {\n        freq[price]++;\n    }\n\n    int prize1 = -1, prize2 = -1, prize3 = -1;\n\n    for (auto it = freq.rbegin(); it != freq.rend(); ++it) {\n        if (prize1 == -1 && it->second >= n1) {\n            prize1 = it->first;\n            it->second -= n1; // Reduce count to avoid reusing the same books\n        } else if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 == -1 && it->first < prize1 && it->second >= n2) {\n            prize2 = it->first;\n            it->second -= n2;\n        } else if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 == -1 && it->first < prize2 && it->second >= n3) {\n            prize3 = it->first;\n            it->second -=n3;\n            break; // Found all prizes\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 != -1) {\n        cout << prize1 << \" \" << prize2 << \" \" << prize3 << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",
    "solutions_anthropicclaude37sonnet_0.4": "# Computer Science Exam Solutions\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the maximum possible value of the expression `x%2024`, where x is an integer in the range [0, 10^9).\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe modulo operation `x%2024` returns the remainder when x is divided by 2024. The maximum value of this expression will be 2024-1 = 2023, which occurs when x is one less than a multiple of 2024.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of the expression `x%2024` is 2023, so the correct answer is c. 2023.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine which of the three functions f1, f2, and f3 return the same value when called with n=24.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's calculate the value returned by each function for n=24:\n\n1. f1(24) = 24*(24+1)/2 = 24*25/2 = 600/2 = 300\n2. f2(24) is the sum of numbers from 1 to 24: 1+2+3+...+24 = 300\n3. f3(24): We need to trace the recursion:\n   - f3(24) = 24²/4 + 2*f3(12) = 144 + 2*f3(12)\n   - f3(12) = 12²/4 + 2*f3(6) = 36 + 2*f3(6)\n   - f3(6) = 6²/4 + 2*f3(3) = 9 + 2*f3(3)\n   - f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + 4 + 2*f3(1) = 7 + 2*f3(1)\n   - f3(2) = 2²/4 + 2*f3(1) = 1 + 2*f3(1)\n   - f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n   - Working back: f3(2) = 1 + 2*1 = 3\n   - f3(3) = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - f3(6) = 9 + 2*6 = 21\n   - f3(12) = 36 + 2*21 = 78\n   - f3(24) = 144 + 2*78 = 300\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions return 300 for n=24, so the answer is d. f1, f2 și f3.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the 7th preparat (dish) generated using backtracking with specific constraints:\n1. Conopidă and broccoli can't be used together, and if one is used, it must be first\n2. Pătrunjel, if used, must be last\n3. If smântână and cașcaval are both used, smântână must come before cașcaval\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the first 5 dishes to understand the pattern:\n1. (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2. (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3. (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4. (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5. (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n\nThe 6th dish would be: (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel)\nThe 7th dish would be: (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n\n### Answer\nThe 7th dish is (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel), so the answer is b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a tree with 10 nodes represented by the \"father\" vector (7,4,6,7,0,4,7,9,6,5). We need to find the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFirst, let's understand the father vector: the value at position i represents the parent of node i+1.\nSo: \n- Node 1's parent is 7\n- Node 2's parent is 4\n- Node 3's parent is 6\n- And so on...\n\nA leaf node is one that doesn't have any children, meaning it doesn't appear as a parent in the vector.\nLet's count which nodes appear as parents: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9\nSo the nodes that are not parents (leaf nodes) are: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10\n\n### Answer\nThere are 5 leaf nodes, so the answer is b. 5.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets (nodes), with one market connected directly to the other four by bidirectional transport bands (edges). We need to find the minimum number of additional bidirectional transport bands to make the graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if all vertices have even degree. Currently, we have one node with degree 4 and four nodes with degree 1. To make all vertices have even degree, we need to add edges to make the degree of each node even.\n\nThe four nodes with degree 1 need to have their degree increased to 2 (or another even number). The most efficient way is to connect these nodes in pairs, which requires 2 additional edges.\n\n### Answer\nWe need to add 2 bidirectional transport bands, so the answer is b. 2.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm that processes a sequence of numbers and determine its output for given inputs.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's trace the algorithm step by step:\n1. Read n = 4\n2. Initialize m = 0, i = 4\n3. Loop while i ≥ 1:\n   - Read x = 721\n   - While x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10:\n     - x = [x/10] = 72\n     - x%10 = 2, [x/10]%10 = 7, condition is true\n     - x = [x/10] = 7\n     - x%10 = 7, [x/10]%10 = 0, condition is false, exit loop\n   - m = 0 + 7 = 7, i = 3\n   - Read x = 20020\n   - While x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10:\n     - x%10 = 0, [x/10]%10 = 2, condition is true\n     - x = [x/10] = 2002\n     - x%10 = 2, [x/10]%10 = 0, condition is false, exit loop\n   - m = 7 + 2002 = 2009, i = 2\n   - Read x = 1321\n   - While x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10:\n     - x%10 = 1, [x/10]%10 = 2, condition is true\n     - x = [x/10] = 132\n     - x%10 = 2, [x/10]%10 = 3, condition is true\n     - x = [x/10] = 13\n     - x%10 = 3, [x/10]%10 = 1, condition is false, exit loop\n   - m = 2009 + 13 = 2022, i = 1\n   - Read x = 211\n   - While x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10:\n     - x%10 = 1, [x/10]%10 = 1, condition is true\n     - x = [x/10] = 21\n     - x%10 = 1, [x/10]%10 = 2, condition is true\n     - x = [x/10] = 2\n     - x%10 = 2, [x/10]%10 = 0, condition is false, exit loop\n   - m = 2022 + 2 = 2024, i = 0\n4. Check if m ≠ n: 2024 ≠ 4, so output is 2024\n\n### Answer\na. The algorithm outputs: 2024\n\nb. For n = 2, to get \"egal\" output, we need m = 2. If we read two numbers that, after processing, sum to 2, we'll get \"egal\". Examples: 10 and 10 (each becomes 1 after processing, and 1+1=2)\n\nc. C++ program:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m = 0, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    i = n;\n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    if (m != n)\n        cout << m;\n    else\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd.

Read n and the text\n2. Split the text into words\n3. Categorize words based on their length compared to n\n4.

Read n1, n2, and n3 from the file\n2. Read all book prices and count the frequency of each price\n3. Sort the prices in descending order\n4. Find the highest price that has at least n1 books\n5. Find the highest price less than the first one that has at least n2 books\n6. Find the highest price less than the second one that has at least n3 books\n7. Output the three prices if they exist\n\n### Answer\na. Algorithm description:\n1. Read n1, n2, and n3 from the file\n2. Read all book prices and store them in a frequency array\n3. Iterate through the prices in descending order to find the three required prices\n4. If all three prices are found, output them; otherwise, output \"nu exista\"\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n- It uses a frequency array instead of sorting all prices\n- It processes each price at most once\n- Time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of books\n\nb.
