The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe maximum remainder when dividing by a number `n` is always `n-1`. This occurs when the dividend is one less than a multiple of `n`.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of `x % 2024` is 2024 - 1 = 2023.  Therefore, the correct answer is **c. 2023**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given three functions, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, and we need to determine which of them produce the same result when called with `n = 24`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each function for n=24:\n\n*   **f1(24):**  `24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 24 * 25 / 2 = 12 * 25 = 300`\n*   **f2(24):** This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.  It's equivalent to `n * (n + 1) / 2`.  Therefore, `f2(24) = 24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 300`.\n*   **f3(24):**\n    *   `n` is not 0.\n    *   `n` is even (24 % 2 == 0).\n    *   Return `24 * 24 / 4 + 2 * f3(24 / 2) = 144 + 2 * f3(12)`\n    *   `f3(12)`:\n        *   `n` is not 0.\n        *   `n` is even.\n        *   Return `12 * 12 / 4 + 2 * f3(6) = 36 + 2 * f3(6)`\n        *   `f3(6)`:\n            *   `n` is not 0.\n            *   `n` is even.\n            *   Return `6 * 6 / 4 + 2 * f3(3) = 9 + 2 * f3(3)`\n            *   `f3(3)`:\n                *   `n` is not 0.\n                *   `n` is odd.\n                *   Return `3 + f3(2)`\n                *   `f3(2)`:\n                    *   `n` is not 0.\n                    *   `n` is even.\n                    *   Return `2 * 2 / 4 + 2 * f3(1) = 1 + 2 * f3(1)`\n                    *    `f3(1)`:\n                        *   `n` is not 0.\n                        *   `n` is odd.\n                        *   Return `1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n                    * Return `1 + 2 * 1 = 3`\n                * Return `3 + 3 = 6`\n            * Return `9 + 2 * 6 = 9 + 12 = 21`\n        * Return `36 + 2 * 21 = 36 + 42 = 78`\n    * Return `144 + 2 * 78 = 144 + 156 = 300`\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions, `f1(24)`, `f2(24)`, and `f3(24)`, evaluate to 300.

We need to find the seventh generated combination.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll list the combinations, following the rules:\n\n1.  **Rule 1:** Cauliflower and broccoli cannot be together. If either is present, it's first.\n2.  **Rule 2:** Parsley, if present, is last.\n3.  **Rule 3:** If cream and cheese are together, cream comes before cheese.\n\nGiven the first five:\n\n1.  (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2.  (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3.  (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4.  (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5.  (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n\nContinuing the generation:\n\n6.  (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n7.  (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel)\n8. (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n\n### Answer\nThe seventh generated combination is (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel). However, this is not an option. Let's re-examine the generation, paying close attention to all rules and the provided examples. The provided examples themselves have an issue. In example 5, (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou), pătrunjel is not last, violating rule 2.  This means the provided examples are incorrect, and we must generate from scratch.\n\n1. (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2. (broccoli, cașcaval, smântână, pătrunjel)\n3. (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n4. (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n5. (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n6. (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n7. (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)\n\nNow, the seventh combination is (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval). This corresponds to option **a. (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)**\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **a. (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a tree represented by a \"parent\" vector, and we need to find the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA leaf node is a node that does not have any children. In the \"parent\" vector representation, a node is a leaf if its index does not appear in the vector as a parent.\n\n### Answer\nThe parent vector is (7, 4, 6, 7, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5). The nodes are numbered 1 to 10. The root is indicated by 0.\n\n*   1: Parent is 7\n*   2: Parent is 4\n*   3: Parent is 6\n*   4: Parent is 7\n*   5: Parent is 4\n*   6: Parent is 7\n*   7: Parent is 0 (root)\n*   8: Parent is 9\n*   9: Parent is 6\n*   10: Parent is 5\n\nThe parents present in the vector are {7, 4, 6, 9, 5}. The nodes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The leaf nodes are the nodes that are *not* parents: {1, 2, 3, 8, 10}.  There are 5 leaf nodes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **b. 5**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets, one connected to all others. We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional transport lanes to add to make the resulting graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have even degrees.  Initially, we have one central market connected to the other four.  This means:\n\n*   Central market: Degree 4\n*   Other markets: Degree 1\n\nTo make the graph Eulerian, we need to make the degree of each of the four outer markets even.  We can achieve this by connecting them in pairs.\n\n### Answer\nWe need to add edges to connect the degree-1 nodes in pairs.  This requires 4 / 2 = 2 additional edges. Therefore, the correct answer is **b. 2**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm reads `n` numbers. For each number `x`, it repeatedly removes the last digit as long as the last digit is less than or equal to the second-to-last digit.  It then adds the resulting `x` to `m`. Finally, it compares `m` to `n` and prints `m` if they are different, or \"egal\" if they are equal.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll analyze each part of the problem separately.\n\n**a.** We'll trace the algorithm with the given input:\n\n*   n = 4\n*   m = 0\n*   i = 4\n\n    *   x = 721.  721 -> 72 (1 <= 2). 72 -> 7 (2 <= 7).  m = 0 + 7 = 7. i = 3\n    *   x = 20020. 20020 -> 2002 (0 <= 2). 2002 -> 200 (2 <= 0 is false). m = 7 + 200 = 207. i = 2\n    *   x = 1321. 1321 -> 132 (1 <= 2). 132 -> 13 (2 <= 3). 13 -> 1 (3 <= 1 is false). m = 207 + 1 = 208. i = 1\n    *   x = 211. 211 -> 21 (1 <= 1). 21 -> 2 (1 <= 2). m = 208 + 2 = 210. i = 0\n*   m (210) != n (4). Output: 210\n\n**b.** We need to find a set of distinct numbers in the range [10, 10^4] such that, after processing, `m` equals `n` (which is 2). Since n=2, and the algorithm adds the processed x to m, we need the sum of the processed numbers to be 2. The numbers must be distinct. The only way to achieve this is if i=2 and we have two numbers that are processed to 1.\nFor example: 11 and 21. 11 becomes 1. 21 becomes 2. 1+2 is not equal to n.\nIf n=2, we need two numbers that, after the inner loop, become 1. Examples are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91. We need two distinct numbers.\n\n**c.**  C++ code implementation.\n\n**d.**  Replace the first `cât timp` (while) loop with a `pentru` (for) loop.\n\n### Answer\n**a.** 210\n**b.** 10, 11\n**c.** See Code Solution\n**d.** See Code Solution\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    m = 0;\n    i = n;\n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    if (m != n) {\n        cout << m;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n```cpp\n// d.

We need to print the indices of the columns where the first and last elements are both equal to 2024.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll iterate through the columns (from 0 to 23) and check if `a[0][i]` and `a[3][i]` are both equal to 2024. If they are, we print the column index `i`.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nfor (int i = 0; i < 24; i++) {\n    if (a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024) {\n        cout << i << \" \";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int a[4][24]; // Assuming the array is declared and initialized elsewhere\n\n    // Example initialization (for testing purposes)\n    for(int i=0; i<4; ++i)\n        for(int j=0; j<24; ++j)\n            a[i][j] = 0;\n\n    a[0][2] = 2024;\n    a[3][2] = 2024;\n    a[0][5] = 2024;\n    a[3][5] = 2024;\n    a[0][10] = 100;\n    a[3][10] = 2024;\n    a[0][15]=2024;\n    a[3][15]=10;\n\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 24; i++) {\n        if (a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024) {\n            cout << i << \" \";\n        }\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function `produs` that takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns the product of their common divisors.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.  We can use the Euclidean algorithm for this.\n2.  Iterate through numbers from 1 up to the square root of the GCD.\n3.  For each number `i`, if it's a divisor of the GCD, then both `i` and `gcd / i` are divisors.  Multiply these into the product.  Handle the case where `i * i == gcd` to avoid double-counting.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nlong long produs(int a, int b) {\n    int gcd = a;\n    int temp = b;\n    while (temp) {\n        int r = gcd % temp;\n        gcd = temp;\n        temp = r;\n    }\n\n    long long p = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i * i <= gcd; i++) {\n        if (gcd % i == 0) {\n            p *= i;\n            if (i * i != gcd) {\n                p *= (gcd / i);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return p;\n}\n```\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nlong long produs(int a, int b) {\n    int gcd = a;\n    int temp = b;\n    while (temp) {\n        int r = gcd % temp;\n        gcd = temp;\n        temp = r;\n    }\n\n    long long p = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i * i <= gcd; i++) {\n        if (gcd % i == 0) {\n            p *= i;\n            if (i * i != gcd) {\n                p *= (gcd / i);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return p;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cout << produs(20, 12) << endl; // Output: 8\n    cout << produs(15, 25) << endl; // Output: 5\n    cout << produs(18, 24) << endl; // 36\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a text with distinct words separated by spaces. We need to read an integer `n` and then the text. We must print the words with fewer than `n` characters on one line and the words with more than `n` characters on another line. If either set is empty, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Read the text.\n3.  Iterate through the text, extracting each word.\n4.  For each word, check its length.\n5.  If the length is less than `n`, append it to a string for short words.\n6.  If the length is greater than `n`, append it to a string for long words.\n7.  After processing all words, print the short words string (or \"nu exista\").\n8.  Print the long words string (or \"nu exista\").\n\n### Answer\nSee Code Solution\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <sstream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    cin.ignore(); \n\n    string text;\n    getline(cin, text);\n\n    string short_words = \"\";\n    string long_words = \"\";\n    stringstream ss(text);\n    string word;\n\n    while (ss >> word) {\n        if (word.length() < n) {\n            short_words += word + \" \";\n        } else if (word.length() > n) {\n            long_words += word + \" \";\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (short_words.empty()) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << short_words << endl;\n    }\n\n    if (long_words.empty()) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << long_words << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have `n1`, `n2`, and `n3` representing the number of winners for prizes I, II, and III, respectively. We're given a list of book prices. We need to find the highest prices for each prize category such that we have enough books of that price, and the prices are strictly decreasing (Prize I > Prize II > Prize III).\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and the book prices.\n2.  Create a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each price.\n3.  Iterate through the prices in descending order (from 1000 down to 10).\n4.  For each price, check if we have enough books for Prize I. If so, store the price and decrement the available books.\n5.  Continue iterating for Prize II, checking against the remaining books and ensuring the price is less than Prize I's price.\n6.  Do the same for Prize III.\n7.  If we find prices for all three prizes, print them. Otherwise, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Answer\n**a.** The algorithm's efficiency comes from using a frequency array and iterating in descending order. This avoids sorting the prices, which would take O(m log m) time (where m is the number of books). Instead, we iterate through the possible prices (a constant range [10, 1000]) and the book prices once, resulting in O(m + 1000-10) = O(m) time complexity, which is linear. The space complexity is O(1000-10) = O(1), which is constant, as the frequency array size is fixed.\n\n**b.** See Code Solution\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n1, n2, n3;\n    cin >> n1 >> n2 >> n3;\n\n    vector<int> freq(1001, 0); // Frequency array for prices up to 1000\n    int price;\n    while (cin >> price) {\n        freq[price]++;\n    }\n\n    int prize1 = -1, prize2 = -1, prize3 = -1;\n    int count = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 1000; i >= 10; i--) {\n        count += freq[i];\n\n        if (prize1 == -1 && count >= n1) {\n            prize1 = i;\n            count -= n1;\n        } else if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 == -1 && count >= n2 && i < prize1) {\n            prize2 = i;\n            count -= n2;\n        } else if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 == -1 && count >= n3 && i < prize2) {\n            prize3 = i;\n            break; // No need to continue searching\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 != -1) {\n        cout << prize1 << \" \" << prize2 << \" \" << prize3 << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

The maximum value of this expression will be 2024-1 = 2023, which occurs when x is one less than a multiple of 2024.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of `x%2024` is 2023, which corresponds to option c.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to compare the return values of three functions f1, f2, and f3 when n=24 to determine which functions return the same value.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's calculate the return value of each function for n=24:\n\n1. f1(24) = 24*(24+1)/2 = 24*25/2 = 600/2 = 300\n2. f2(24) = 24 + f2(23) = 24 + 23 + ... + 1 + 0 = sum of numbers from 0 to 24 = 300\n3. f3(24): This is more complex, let's calculate step by step:\n   - Since 24 is even, f3(24) = 24²/4 + 2*f3(12) = 144 + 2*f3(12)\n   - Since 12 is even, f3(12) = 12²/4 + 2*f3(6) = 36 + 2*f3(6)\n   - Since 6 is even, f3(6) = 6²/4 + 2*f3(3) = 9 + 2*f3(3)\n   - Since 3 is odd, f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + 2²/4 + 2*f3(1) = 3 + 1 + 2*f3(1)\n   - Since 1 is odd, f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n   - Working backwards: f3(3) = 3 + 1 + 2*1 = 6\n   - f3(6) = 9 + 2*6 = 21\n   - f3(12) = 36 + 2*21 = 78\n   - f3(24) = 144 + 2*78 = 300\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions return 300 when n=24, so the answer is d. f1, f2 and f3.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the 7th preparat (dish) generated using backtracking with specific constraints:\n1. Conopidă and broccoli cannot be used together, and if one is used, it must be first\n2. Pătrunjel, if used, must be last\n3. If smântână and cașcaval are used together, smântână must come before cașcaval\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the first 5 dishes to understand the generation pattern:\n1. (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2. (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3. (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4. (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5. (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n\nThe 6th dish would be (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel).\nThe 7th dish would be (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel).\n\n### Answer\nThe 7th dish generated is (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel), which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the number of leaf nodes in a tree represented by a \"father\" vector (7,4,6,7,0,4,7,9,6,5).\n\n### Solution Approach\nIn this representation, the value at position i represents the parent of node i+1. A leaf node is one that has no children, meaning no other node has it as a parent.\n\nLet's identify which nodes are parents:\n- Node 4 is parent to nodes 2 and 6\n- Node 5 is parent to node 10\n- Node 6 is parent to nodes 3 and 9\n- Node 7 is parent to nodes 1, 4, and 6\n- Node 9 is parent to node 8\n\nSo nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are parents. The remaining nodes (1, 2, 3, 8, 10) are leaf nodes.\n\n### Answer\nThere are 5 leaf nodes, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a graph with 5 vertices (piețe/markets), where one vertex is connected directly to the other four. We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional edges to add to make the graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all vertices have even degree. Currently:\n- One vertex has degree 4 (connected to all others)\n- Four vertices have degree 1 (connected only to the central vertex)\n\nTo make all vertices have even degree, we need to add edges to the vertices with odd degree (the four vertices with degree 1). We can do this by connecting them in pairs, which requires 2 additional edges.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of edges to add is 2, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm that processes a sequence of numbers and determine its output for given inputs.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe algorithm reads n numbers, and for each number x:\n1. While the last digit of x is less than or equal to the second-to-last digit, it removes the last digit\n2. Adds the resulting number to a sum m\n3. Finally, it compares m with n and outputs accordingly\n\na. For input 4, 721, 20020, 1321, 211:\n- n = 4\n- For x = 721: Last digit (1) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2)? Yes, so x becomes 72.\n  Last digit (2) ≤ Second-to-last digit (7)? Yes, so x becomes 7. m = 0 + 7 = 7\n- For x = 20020: Last digit (0) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2)? Yes, so x becomes 2002.\n  Last digit (2) ≤ Second-to-last digit (0)? No, so x stays 2002. m = 7 + 2002 = 2009\n- For x = 1321: Last digit (1) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2)? Yes, so x becomes 132.\n  Last digit (2) ≤ Second-to-last digit (3)? Yes, so x becomes 13.\n  Last digit (3) ≤ Second-to-last digit (1)? No, so x stays 13. m = 2009 + 13 = 2022\n- For x = 211: Last digit (1) ≤ Second-to-last digit (1)? Yes, so x becomes 21.\n  Last digit (1) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2)? Yes, so x becomes 2. m = 2022 + 2 = 2024\n- Since m = 2024 ≠ n = 4, the output is 2024\n\nb. If n = 2, we need numbers whose sum after processing equals 2.\n   We could use 1 and 1, or 2 and 0, or just 2 by itself.\n   For example: 2, 2 would work because each 2 remains 2 after processing, and 2+0=2.\n\nc.
