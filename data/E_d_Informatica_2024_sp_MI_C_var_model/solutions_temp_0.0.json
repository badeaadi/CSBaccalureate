We need to find the highest prices for each prize such that there are enough books at that price or higher, and the prices are strictly decreasing.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Sort the prices:** Sort the book prices in descending order. This makes it easier to find the highest possible price for each prize.\n2.  **Iterate and Count:** Iterate through the sorted prices. Keep track of the count of books available at each price.\n3.  **Assign Prizes:**\n    *   For Prize I, find the highest price where the count is at least `n1`.\n    *   For Prize II, find the next highest price (lower than Prize I's price) where the count is at least `n1 + n2`.\n    *   For Prize III, find the next highest price (lower than Prize II's price) where the count is at least `n1 + n2 + n3`.\n4. **Efficiency:** Sorting takes O(N log N) time. The iteration and counting take O(N) time.  Overall, the algorithm is O(N log N), which is efficient for the given constraints. We use constant extra space.\n\n### Answer\n\n**(a)**\nThe algorithm first sorts the prices in descending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted prices, keeping track of how many books are available at or above the current price. It tries to assign the highest possible price to each prize (I, II, III), ensuring that there are enough books available for all winners of that prize and any higher prizes, and that the prices are strictly decreasing. This approach is efficient because sorting allows us to quickly find the highest possible prices, and the single iteration ensures we don't perform unnecessary checks. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(N log N), where N is the number of books.\n\n**(b)**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n1, n2, n3;\n    cin >> n1 >> n2 >> n3;\n\n    vector<int> prices;\n    int price;\n    while (cin >> price) {\n        prices.push_back(price);\n    }\n\n    sort(prices.begin(), prices.end(), greater<int>());\n\n    int prize1 = -1, prize2 = -1, prize3 = -1;\n    int count = 0;\n    int i = 0;\n\n    // Find Prize I\n    while (i < prices.size()) {\n        count = 0;\n        int current_price = prices[i];\n        while(i < prices.size() && prices[i] == current_price)\n        {\n            count++;\n            i++;\n        }\n\n        if (count >= n1) {\n            prize1 = current_price;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Find Prize II\n    if (prize1 != -1)\n    {\n        count = 0;\n        i = 0;\n        while (i < prices.size())\n        {\n            count = 0;\n            int current_price = prices[i];\n\n            while(i < prices.size() && prices[i] == current_price)\n            {\n                count++;\n                i++;\n            }\n            if (current_price < prize1 && count >= n1 + n2) {\n                prize2 = current_price;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Find Prize III\n    if(prize2 != -1)\n    {\n        count = 0;\n        i = 0;\n        while (i < prices.size())\n        {\n            count = 0;\n            int current_price = prices[i];\n            while(i < prices.size() && prices[i] == current_price)\n            {\n                count++;\n                i++;\n            }\n            if (current_price < prize2 && count >= n1 + n2 + n3) {\n                prize3 = current_price;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 != -1) {\n        cout << prize1 << \" \" << prize2 << \" \" << prize3 << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

The maximum value of this expression will be 2024-1 = 2023, which occurs when x is one less than a multiple of 2024.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of the expression `x%2024` is 2023, which corresponds to option c.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine which of the three functions f1, f2, and f3 return the same value when called with n=24.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's calculate the value returned by each function for n=24:\n\n1. f1(24) = 24*(24+1)/2 = 24*25/2 = 600/2 = 300\n2. f2(24) = 24 + f2(23) = 24 + 23 + ... + 1 + 0 = sum of numbers from 0 to 24 = 300\n3. f3(24): \n   - Since 24 is even: f3(24) = 24²/4 + 2*f3(12) = 144 + 2*f3(12)\n   - f3(12) = 12²/4 + 2*f3(6) = 36 + 2*f3(6)\n   - f3(6) = 6²/4 + 2*f3(3) = 9 + 2*f3(3)\n   - f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + 2²/4 + 2*f3(1) = 3 + 1 + 2*f3(1)\n   - f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n   - Working backwards: f3(3) = 3 + 1 + 2*1 = 6\n   - f3(6) = 9 + 2*6 = 21\n   - f3(12) = 36 + 2*21 = 78\n   - f3(24) = 144 + 2*78 = 300\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions return 300 for n=24, so the answer is d. f1, f2 and f3.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the 7th preparat (dish) generated using backtracking with specific constraints:\n1. Conopidă and broccoli cannot be used together, and if one is used, it must be first\n2. Pătrunjel, if used, must be last\n3. If smântână and cașcaval are used together, smântână must come before cașcaval\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the first 5 dishes to understand the generation pattern:\n1. (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2. (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3. (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4. (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5. (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n\nThe 6th dish would be: (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel)\nThe 7th dish would be: (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n\n### Answer\nThe 7th dish generated is (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel), which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a tree with 10 nodes represented by a \"father\" vector (7,4,6,7,4,7,0,9,6,5). We need to find the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA leaf node is a node that has no children. To identify leaf nodes, we need to find nodes that don't appear as fathers in the vector.\n\nLet's map the father-child relationships:\n- Node 1 has father 7\n- Node 2 has father 4\n- Node 3 has father 6\n- Node 4 has father 7\n- Node 5 has father 4\n- Node 6 has father 7\n- Node 7 has father 0 (root)\n- Node 8 has father 9\n- Node 9 has father 6\n- Node 10 has father 5\n\nNow, let's identify which nodes are fathers: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9\nNodes that are not fathers are leaf nodes: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10\n\n### Answer\nThere are 5 leaf nodes, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets in a city, with one market directly connected to the other four. We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional transport bands to add to make the graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all vertices have even degree. Currently, we have:\n- One market with degree 4 (connected to all others)\n- Four markets with degree 1 (each connected only to the central market)\n\nTo make all vertices have even degree, we need to add edges to the vertices with odd degree. Since we have 4 vertices with odd degree, we need to add at least 2 edges.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of bidirectional transport bands to add is 2, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm that processes a sequence of numbers and determine its output for given inputs.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe algorithm reads a number n, then n numbers. For each number x, it repeatedly divides by 10 until the last digit is greater than the second-to-last digit. It then adds these processed numbers and compares the sum with n.\n\na) For inputs 4, 721, 20020, 1321, 211:\n- For x=721: Last digit is 1, second-to-last is 2. Since 1≤2, x becomes 72. Now last digit is 2, second-to-last is 7. Since 2≤7, x becomes 7. Now there's only one digit, so we stop. m=0+7=7.\n- For x=20020: Last digit is 0, second-to-last is 2. Since 0≤2, x becomes 2002. This continues until x=2. m=7+2=9.\n- For x=1321: Last digit is 1, second-to-last is 2. Since 1≤2, x becomes 132. Last digit is 2, second-to-last is 3. Since 2≤3, x becomes 13. Last digit is 3, second-to-last is 1. Since 3>1, we stop. m=9+13=22.\n- For x=211: Last digit is 1, second-to-last is 1. Since 1≤1, x becomes 21. Last digit is 1, second-to-last is 2. Since 1≤2, x becomes 2. m=22+2=24.\n\nSince m=24 and n=4, m≠n, so the output is 24.\n\nb) If n=2, we need two numbers whose sum after processing equals 2. We can use:\n- 10 (processes to 1)\n- 10 (processes to 1)\nSince 1+1=2=n, the output will be \"egal\".\n\nc) C++ program:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m = 0, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    i = n;\n    \n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    \n    if (m != n)\n        cout << m;\n    else\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd) Algorithm with for loop:\n```\ncitește n (număr natural nenul)\nm0\npentru i←n, 1, -1 execută\n    citește x (număr natural)\n    cât timp x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 execută\n        x[x/10]\n    ■\n    mm+x\n■\ndacă m≠n atunci scrie m\naltfel scrie „egal\"\n■\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a structure for a phone with specific fields and declare a variable of this type.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe structure needs to store:\n- Producer (a capital letter)\n- Processor frequency (natural number)\n- Dimensions (width, thickness, length as real numbers)\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3]; // [0]-width, [1]-thickness, [2]-length\n};\n\ntelefon t;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write code to display the indices of columns in a 2D array where both the first and last elements equal 2024.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll iterate through all columns and check if both a[0][j] and a[3][j] equal 2024.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nfor(i = 0; i < 24; i++)\n    if(a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024)\n        cout << i << \" \";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function that returns the product of all common divisors of two natural numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, then find all divisors of the GCD and multiply them.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\nint produs(int a, int b) {\n    // Find GCD using Euclidean algorithm\n    int gcd = a;\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = gcd % b;\n        gcd = temp;\n    }\n    \n    // Find all divisors of GCD and calculate their product\n    int result = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= gcd; i++) {\n        if (gcd % i == 0) {\n            result *= i;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a program that reads a number n and a text, then outputs words with fewer than n letters on one line and words with more than n letters on another line.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll parse the text word by word, check each word's length against n, and place it in the appropriate category.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    char text[101];\n    bool hasLess = false, hasMore = false;\n    \n    cin >> n;\n    cin.ignore(); // Clear the newline after reading n\n    cin.getline(text, 101);\n    \n    char *word = strtok(text, \" \");\n    \n    // First line: words with fewer than n letters\n    while (word != NULL) {\n        if (strlen(word) < n) {\n            cout << word << \" \";\n            hasLess = true;\n        }\n        word = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n    \n    if (!hasLess) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n    \n    // Reset for second pass\n    strcpy(text, \"\");\n    cin.getline(text, 101);\n    word = strtok(text, \" \");\n    \n    // Second line: words with more than n letters\n    while (word != NULL) {\n        if (strlen(word) > n) {\n            cout << word << \" \";\n            hasMore = true;\n        }\n        word = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n    \n    if (!hasMore) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the prices for three types of prizes, where each prize must have a sufficient number of books available at that price, and the prices must be in strictly decreasing order.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Count the frequency of each price in the input\n2. Sort the prices in descending order\n3. Find the highest price with at least n1 books, then the highest price less than that with at least n2 books, and finally the highest price less than that with at least n3 books\n\n### Algorithm Description\n1. Read n1, n2, n3 from the file\n2. Read all book prices and count the frequency of each price\n3. Create a sorted list of unique prices in descending order\n4. Iterate through the sorted prices to find the three prize prices\n5. Output the three prices if found, or \"nu exista\" if not possible\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <map>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    int n1, n2, n3;\n    fin >> n1 >> n2 >> n3;\n    \n    // Count frequency of each price\n    map<int, int> frequency;\n    int price;\n    while (fin >> price) {\n        frequency[price]++;\n    }\n    \n    // Create sorted list of unique prices\n    vector<int> prices;\n    for (auto& pair : frequency) {\n        prices.push_back(pair.first);\n    }\n    sort(prices.begin(), prices.end(), greater<int>());\n    \n    // Find the three prize prices\n    int prize1 = -1, prize2 = -1, prize3 = -1;\n    \n    for (int p : prices) {\n        if (frequency[p] >= n1 && prize1 == -1) {\n            prize1 = p;\n        } else if (frequency[p] >= n2 && prize2 == -1 && p < prize1) {\n            prize2 = p;\n        } else if (frequency[p] >= n3 && prize3 == -1 && p < prize2) {\n            prize3 = p;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 != -1) {\n        cout << prize1 << \" \" << prize2 << \" \" << prize3;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n1. It uses a map to count frequencies in O(n log n) time\n2. It only needs to iterate through the unique prices once\n3. It avoids unnecessary comparisons by breaking early when all three prizes are found"
