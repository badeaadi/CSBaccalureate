Therefore, the correct answer is **c. 2023**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given three functions, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, and we need to determine which of them produce the same result when called with `n = 24`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each function for n = 24:\n\n*   **f1(24):**  `24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 24 * 25 / 2 = 12 * 25 = 300`\n*   **f2(24):** This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.  It's the same as f1(n). `f2(24) = 24 + 23 + ... + 1 = 300`\n*   **f3(24):**\n    *   `f3(24) = 24 * 24 / 4 + 2 * f3(12) = 144 + 2 * f3(12)`\n    *   `f3(12) = 12 * 12 / 4 + 2 * f3(6) = 36 + 2 * f3(6)`\n    *   `f3(6) = 6 * 6 / 4 + 2 * f3(3) = 9 + 2 * f3(3)`\n    *   `f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + (2*2/4 + 2*f3(1)) = 3 + 1 + 2*(1+f3(0)) = 4 + 2 * (1 + 0) = 6`\n    *   `f3(6) = 9 + 2 * 6 = 9 + 12 = 21`\n    *   `f3(12) = 36 + 2 * 21 = 36 + 42 = 78`\n    *   `f3(24) = 144 + 2 * 78 = 144 + 156 = 300`\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions, f1, f2, and f3, return 300 when called with n=24.

In the \"parent\" vector representation, a node is a leaf if its index does not appear in the vector.\n\n### Answer\nLet's examine the parent vector: `(7, 4, 6, 7, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5)`. The nodes are numbered 1 to 10. The root is indicated by 0.\n* Node 1: Parent is 7\n* Node 2: Parent is 4\n* Node 3: Parent is 6\n* Node 4: Parent is 7\n* Node 5: Parent is 4\n* Node 6: Parent is 7\n* Node 7: Parent is 0 (Root)\n* Node 8: Parent is 9\n* Node 9: Parent is 6\n* Node 10: Parent is 5\n\nThe nodes that appear as parents are: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.\nThe nodes that *do not* appear as parents are: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10.\nThere are 5 such nodes.

We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional transport bands to add to make the resulting graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have even degrees.  Initially, we have one central market connected to the other four.\n*   Central market: degree 4\n*   Other markets: degree 1\n\nTo make the graph Eulerian, we need to make the degree of each of the other four markets even. We can achieve this by adding edges between them.  The most efficient way is to connect them in pairs.\n\n### Answer\nWe need to add edges to connect the four degree-1 nodes in pairs. This requires 4/2 = 2 additional edges.\n\nThe answer is **b. 2**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm reads a number `n` followed by `n` other numbers. For each of these numbers, it extracts the leftmost digit while the last digit is less than or equal to the second to last digit. It then sums these extracted digits. Finally, it compares the sum `m` with the initial `n`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll analyze each part of the problem separately.\n\n**a.**\nWe'll trace the algorithm with the given input: 4, 721, 20020, 1321, 211.\n\n*   n = 4\n*   m = 0\n*   **i = 4, x = 721:**\n    *   721 % 10 (1) <= 72 % 10 (2) - true\n    *   x = 72\n    *   72 % 10 (2) <= 7 % 10 (7) - true\n    *   x = 7\n    *   7 % 10 (7) <= 0 - false (loop terminates)\n    *   m = 0 + 7 = 7\n    *   i = 3\n*   **i = 3, x = 20020:**\n    *   x becomes 2\n    *   m = 7+2=9\n    *   i=2\n*  **i = 2, x = 1321:**\n    *   x becomes 1\n    *   m = 9+1 = 10\n    *   i = 1\n*   **i = 1, x = 211:**\n    *   x becomes 2\n    *   m = 10 + 2 = 12\n    *   i = 0\n*   m (12) != n (4), so it prints 12.\n\n**b.**\nWe need to find a set of numbers such that the sum of their leftmost digits equals 2 (the value of `n`). Since the numbers must be distinct and within the range [10, 10^4], we can choose numbers whose leftmost digit is extracted and whose sum is 2.  We can use the numbers 10 (leftmost digit 1) and 11 (leftmost digit 1).\n\n**c.**\nC++ code solution is provided below.\n\n**d.**\nPseudocode solution with `for` loop is provided below.\n\n### Answer\n**a.** 12\n**b.** 10, 11 (or any other two distinct numbers between 10 and 10000 that start with 1 and satisfy the inner while condition, like 12, 19, 100, 1000, etc., so their first digit is 1)\n**c.** See Code Solution.\n**d.** See Code Solution.\n\n### Code Solution (C++)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    m = 0;\n    i = n;\n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    if (m != n) {\n        cout << m;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Code Solution (Pseudocode - d)\n```\ncitește n (număr natural nenul)\nm <- 0\npentru i <- n, 1, -1 execută\n    citește x (număr natural)\n    ┌cât timp x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 execută\n    │  x <- [x/10]\n    └■\n    m <- m + x\nsfarsit_pentru\n┌dacă m ≠ n atunci scrie m\n│altfel scrie „egal”\n└■\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a structure named `telefon` to store information about a phone: producer (a single character), processor frequency (an integer), and dimensions (width, thickness, and length, all floats).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll use the `struct` keyword in C++ to define the structure, including the specified members.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3];\n};\n\ntelefon t;\n```\n\n### Code Solution (C++)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3];\n};\n\nint main() {\n    telefon t;\n\n    // Example usage (not required by the problem, but good for demonstration)\n    t.producator = 'S';\n    t.frecventa = 2800;\n    t.dimensiune[0] = 75.5; // Width\n    t.dimensiune[1] = 8.2;  // Thickness\n    t.dimensiune[2] = 160.1; // Length\n\n    cout << \"Producator: \" << t.producator << endl;\n    cout << \"Frecventa: \" << t.frecventa << endl;\n    cout << \"Latime: \" << t.dimensiune[0] << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a 2D array `a` with 4 rows and 24 columns.

This allows us to efficiently check how many books are available at a given price. We then iterate through the possible prices in descending order. This ensures that we find the highest possible price for each prize level. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting (if we were to sort, but we don't need to) and the frequency counting, which is O(N), where N is the number of books.  Since the prices are in the range [10, 10^3], a simple array can be used for frequency counting, making the search for suitable prices very efficient (at most 1000-10 = 990 iterations).\n\n**b. C++ Code:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    int n1, n2, n3, price;\n    fin >> n1 >> n2 >> n3;\n\n    vector<int> freq(1001, 0); // Frequency array for prices from 10 to 1000\n\n    while (fin >> price) {\n        freq[price]++;\n    }\n\n    int prize1 = -1, prize2 = -1, prize3 = -1;\n\n    for (int p = 1000; p >= 10; p--) {\n        if (prize1 == -1 && freq[p] >= n1) {\n            prize1 = p;\n        } else if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 == -1 && freq[p] >= n2 && p < prize1) {\n            prize2 = p;\n        } else if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 == -1 && freq[p] >= n3 && p < prize2) {\n            prize3 = p;\n        }\n    }\n    fin.close();\n\n    if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 != -1) {\n        cout << prize1 << \" \" << prize2 << \" \" << prize3 << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Code Solution (C++)\n(Same as Answer b above)\n",

The maximum value will be 2024-1 = 2023, which occurs when x is one less than a multiple of 2024.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of the expression `x%2024` is 2023, corresponding to option c.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to compare the results of three functions f1, f2, and f3 when n=24 and determine which functions return the same value.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's calculate the value returned by each function for n=24:\n\n1. f1(24) = 24*(24+1)/2 = 24*25/2 = 600/2 = 300\n2. f2(24) = 24 + f2(23) = 24 + 23 + f2(22) = ... = 24 + 23 + ... + 1 + 0 = sum of numbers from 1 to 24 = 300\n3. f3(24): This is more complex, let's calculate step by step:\n   - f3(24) = 24²/4 + 2*f3(12) = 144 + 2*f3(12)\n   - f3(12) = 12²/4 + 2*f3(6) = 36 + 2*f3(6)\n   - f3(6) = 6²/4 + 2*f3(3) = 9 + 2*f3(3)\n   - f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + 4 + 2*f3(1) = 3 + 4 + 2*(1 + f3(0)) = 3 + 4 + 2*(1 + 0) = 9\n   - So f3(6) = 9 + 2*9 = 27\n   - f3(12) = 36 + 2*27 = 90\n   - f3(24) = 144 + 2*90 = 324\n\n### Answer\nf1(24) = 300, f2(24) = 300, f3(24) = 324\nTherefore, functions f1 and f2 return the same value (300), corresponding to option a.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the seventh preparat (dish) generated using backtracking based on specific constraints for arranging ingredients in a tray.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n1. Conopidă and broccoli cannot be used in the same dish, and if one is used, it must be placed first.\n2. If pătrunjel is used, it must be placed last.\n3. If smântână and cașcaval are used in the same dish, smântână must be placed before cașcaval.\n\nThe first five dishes are given:\n1. (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2. (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3. (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4. (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5. (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n\nTo find the sixth and seventh dishes, we need to continue the generation:\n6. (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel)\n7. (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n\n### Answer\nThe seventh preparat generated is (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel), corresponding to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a tree with 10 nodes represented by a \"father\" vector (7,4,6,7,4,7,0,9,6,5). We need to find the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nIn a tree, leaf nodes are those that don't have any children. To identify them, we need to find which nodes are not parents to any other node.\n\nFrom the given vector, we can determine:\n- Node 1's parent is 7\n- Node 2's parent is 4\n- Node 3's parent is 6\n- Node 4's parent is 7\n- Node 5's parent is 4\n- Node 6's parent is 7\n- Node 7's parent is 0 (root)\n- Node 8's parent is 9\n- Node 9's parent is 6\n- Node 10's parent is 5\n\nTo find the leaf nodes, we need to identify which nodes are not parents to any other node. The nodes that appear in the father vector are: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. The nodes that don't appear (and thus are leaf nodes) are: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10.\n\n### Answer\nThe number of leaf nodes is 5, corresponding to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a city with 5 markets, where one market is directly connected to the other four via bidirectional transport bands. We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional transport bands that need to be added so that the resulting undirected graph is Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all vertices have even degrees. Currently, we have one vertex with degree 4 (connected to all others) and four vertices with degree 1 (each connected only to the central vertex).\n\nTo make the graph Eulerian, we need to add edges so that all vertices have even degrees. The vertices with degree 1 need one more edge each to reach degree 2 (even). We can add these edges between the vertices of degree 1.\n\nSince we have 4 vertices of degree 1, we need to add at least 2 edges to make all their degrees even.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of bidirectional transport bands to be added is 2, corresponding to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm that processes a sequence of numbers and determine its behavior for specific inputs.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe algorithm reads a number n, then reads n numbers. For each number x, it repeatedly divides x by 10 until the last digit is greater than the second-to-last digit. It then adds all these processed numbers and compares the sum with the initial n.\n\na) For the input 4, 721, 20020, 1321, 211:\n- i=4, m=0\n- Read x=721: 721%10=1, [721/10]%10=2, 1≤2, so x=[721/10]=72\n  - 72%10=2, [72/10]%10=7, 2≤7, so x=[72/10]=7\n  - 7%10=7, no second-to-last digit, exit loop\n  - m=0+7=7, i=3\n- Read x=20020: 20020%10=0, [20020/10]%10=2, 0≤2, so x=[20020/10]=2002\n  - 2002%10=2, [2002/10]%10=0, 2>0, exit loop\n  - m=7+2002=2009, i=2\n- Read x=1321: 1321%10=1, [1321/10]%10=2, 1≤2, so x=[1321/10]=132\n  - 132%10=2, [132/10]%10=3, 2≤3, so x=[132/10]=13\n  - 13%10=3, [13/10]%10=1, 3>1, exit loop\n  - m=2009+13=2022, i=1\n- Read x=211: 211%10=1, [211/10]%10=1, 1≤1, so x=[211/10]=21\n  - 21%10=1, [21/10]%10=2, 1≤2, so x=[21/10]=2\n  - 2%10=2, no second-to-last digit, exit loop\n  - m=2022+2=2024, i=0\n- Since m=2024 and n=4, m≠n, so the output is 2024.\n\nb) If the first number is 2, we need to find distinct numbers that will make the sum equal to 2.\nFor example: 1 and 1.
