The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe maximum remainder when dividing by a number `n` is always `n-1`. This occurs when the dividend is one less than a multiple of `n`.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of `x % 2024` is 2024 - 1 = 2023.  Therefore, the correct answer is **c. 2023**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have three functions, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, and we need to determine which of them produce the same result when called with `n = 24`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each function for n=24:\n\n*   **f1(24):**  `24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 24 * 25 / 2 = 12 * 25 = 300`\n*   **f2(24):** This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.  It's equivalent to f1. `f2(24) = 24 + 23 + ... + 1 = 300` (using the formula n*(n+1)/2)\n*   **f3(24):**\n    *   `f3(24) = 24*24/4 + 2*f3(12) = 144 + 2*f3(12)`\n    *   `f3(12) = 12*12/4 + 2*f3(6) = 36 + 2*f3(6)`\n    *   `f3(6) = 6*6/4 + 2*f3(3) = 9 + 2*f3(3)`\n    *   `f3(3) = 3 + f3(2)`\n    *   `f3(2) = 2*2/4 + 2*f3(1) = 1 + 2*f3(1)`\n    *   `f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `f3(2) = 1 + 2*1 = 3`\n    *   `f3(3) = 3 + 3 = 6`\n    *   `f3(6) = 9 + 2*6 = 21`\n    *   `f3(12) = 36 + 2*21 = 78`\n    *   `f3(24) = 144 + 2*78 = 144 + 156 = 300`\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions, `f1(24)`, `f2(24)`, and `f3(24)`, evaluate to 300.

In the \"parent\" vector representation, a node is a leaf if its index does not appear in the parent vector as a parent.\n\n### Answer\nThe parent vector is (7, 4, 6, 7, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5). The nodes are numbered 1 to 10. The root is node 7 (parent 0).\n\nLet's check which nodes are parents:\n\n*   7 is a parent (nodes 1, 4, 6)\n*   4 is a parent (nodes 2, 5)\n*   6 is a parent (nodes 3, 9)\n*   9 is a parent (node 8)\n*   5 is a parent (node 10)\n\nThe nodes that are *not* parents are: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10. These are the leaf nodes. There are 5 leaf nodes.

We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional transport lanes to add to make the resulting graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have even degree (number of edges connected to the vertex).  Initially, one market has degree 4, and the other four markets have degree 1.\n\n### Answer\n*   The central market (connected to all others) already has an even degree (4).\n*   The other four markets each have an odd degree (1).\n\nTo make the graph Eulerian, we need to make the degree of all vertices even. We can connect the four markets with odd degrees in pairs. This requires adding two edges.  Therefore, the correct answer is **b. 2**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm reads `n` numbers. For each number `x`, it removes digits from the right as long as the last digit is less than or equal to the second-to-last digit.  It then sums the resulting `x` values into `m`.

Read `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and the book prices.\n2.  Create a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each price.\n3.  Iterate downwards from the maximum possible price (1000).\n4.  For each price, check if there are enough books for prize I. If so, store the price.\n5.  Continue iterating downwards, checking for prize II (price must be less than prize I's price), and then prize III.\n6.  If at any point we can't find a suitable price, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Answer\n**a. Algorithm Description and Justification:**\n\nThe algorithm uses a frequency array to store the count of each book price. This allows us to efficiently check if there are enough books of a given price. We iterate in descending order from the maximum possible price (1000) to find the highest possible prices for each prize level, ensuring the strictly decreasing order. This approach is efficient because:\n\n1.  **Time Complexity:**  Reading the input takes O(N) time, where N is the number of books. Creating the frequency array takes O(1) time (since the range of prices is fixed [10, 1000]).  The iteration to find the prices takes at most O(1000) time, which is constant. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N), which is linear and efficient.\n2.  **Space Complexity:** The frequency array takes O(1) space (constant space, as it has a fixed size of 1001).\n\n**b.

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe maximum remainder when dividing by a number `n` is `n-1`. This occurs when the dividend is one less than a multiple of `n`.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of `x % 2024` is 2024 - 1 = 2023.  Therefore, the correct answer is **c. 2023**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given three functions, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, and we need to determine which of them produce the same result when called with `n = 24`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each function for n=24:\n\n*   **f1(24):**  `24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 24 * 25 / 2 = 12 * 25 = 300`\n*   **f2(24):** This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.  It's equivalent to `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

(broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2.  (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3.  (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4.  (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5.  (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n6.  (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n7.  (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel)\n\n### Answer\nThe seventh generated combination is (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel). Therefore the correct answer is none of the provided options. Since the closest option is a, but it is not correct, we will still choose the closest, but note that it is incorrect. The closest, but incorrect, answer is **a.

We can count the number of nodes that are *not* parents. The root is indicated by 0.\n\n### Answer\nThe parent vector is (7, 4, 6, 7, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5). The nodes are numbered 1 to 10.\nThe parents present in the vector are: 7, 4, 6, 9, 5.\nThe root is 7 (indicated by 0).\nNodes that are *not* parents are: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10. There are 5 such nodes.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 leaf nodes. The correct answer is **b. 5**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets, one connected to all others. We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional transport lanes to add to make the graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have even degree.  Initially, one market (vertex) has degree 4, and the other four markets have degree 1.\n\n### Answer\n*   One vertex has degree 4 (even).\n*   Four vertices have degree 1 (odd).\n\nTo make all vertices have even degree, we need to add edges to pair up the odd-degree vertices.  We need to add edges between two pairs of the degree-1 vertices. This requires adding 2 edges.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of bidirectional lanes to add is 2. The correct answer is **b. 2**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm reads `n` numbers. For each number `x`, it removes digits from the right as long as the last digit is less than or equal to the second-to-last digit.  It sums the resulting `x` values into `m`. Finally, it prints `m` if `m` is not equal to `n`, and \"egal\" otherwise.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will trace the algorithm for the given inputs and then find a set of inputs that result in \"egal\".\n\n### Answer a\nLet's trace the algorithm with the inputs 4, 721, 20020, 1321, 211:\n\n1.  **n = 4, m = 0**\n2.  **i = 4, x = 721:**\n    *   `1 <= 2` is true, `x = 72`\n    *   `2 <= 7` is true, `x = 7`\n    *   Loop terminates. `m = 0 + 7 = 7`, `i = 3`\n3.  **i = 3, x = 20020:**\n    *   `0 <= 2` is true, `x = 2002`\n    *   `2 <= 0` is false. Loop terminates. `m = 7 + 2002 = 2009`, `i = 2`\n4.  **i = 2, x = 1321:**\n    *   `1 <= 2` is true, `x = 132`\n    *   `2 <= 3` is true, `x = 13`\n    *   `3 <= 1` is false. Loop terminates. `m = 2009 + 13 = 2022`, `i = 1`\n5.  **i = 1, x = 211:**\n    *   `1 <= 1` is true, `x = 21`\n    *   `1 <= 2` is true, `x = 2`\n    *   Loop terminates. `m = 2022 + 2 = 2024`, `i = 0`\n6.  `i` becomes 0, the outer loop terminates.\n7.  `m (2024) != n (4)` is true, so the algorithm prints `2024`.\n\nThe output is **2024**.\n\n### Answer b\nWe need `m = n = 2`.  We need two distinct numbers in the range \\[10, 10000].\n\nLet's try to get `m = 2`.\nWe need two numbers (since n=2), and their processed sum should be 2.\nIf the first number is x1, and the second number is x2, then the processed x1 + processed x2 = 2.\nIf we choose 11 as the first number, after processing, x1 = 1.\nIf we choose 11 as the second number, after processing, x2 = 1.\n1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, a valid set of numbers is 11, 11. However, the numbers must be distinct.\nLet's try 10 and 12.\nx1 = 10.  0 <= 1, x1 = 1.\nx2 = 12. 2 <= 1 is false, x2 = 12.\n1 + 12 = 13, not 2.\nLet's try 20 and 10.\nx1 = 20. 0 <= 2, x1 = 2.\nx2 = 10. 0 <= 1, x2 = 1.\n2 + 1 = 3, not 2.\nLet's try 10 and any number >=10 that starts with 1.\nx1 = 10, processed x1 = 1.\nWe need processed x2 = 1.\nIf x2 = 11, processed x2 = 1.\nIf x2 = 12, processed x2 = 12.\nIf x2 = 19, processed x2 = 19.\nIf x2 = 10, processed x2 = 1.\nIf x2 = 100, processed x2 = 1.\nIf x2 = 1000, processed x2 = 1.\nIf x2 = 10000, processed x2 = 1.\nSo, we can use 10 and 100.\n\nA valid set of distinct numbers is **10, 100**.\n\n### Answer c\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    m = 0;\n    i = n;\n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    if (m != n) {\n        cout << m << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"egal\" << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Answer d\n```pseudocode\ncitește n (număr natural nenul)\nm0\npentru in,1,-1 execută\n│ citește x (număr natural)\n│┌cât timp x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 execută\n││ x[x/10]\n│└■\n│ mm+x\n└■\n┌dacă m≠n atunci scrie m\n│altfel scrie „egal”\n└■\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a structure named `telefon` to store information about a phone: producer (a character), processor frequency (an integer), and dimensions (width, thickness, and length, all floats).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will define a structure with the specified members and declare the variable `t`.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3]; // Or: float latime, grosime, lungime;\n};\n\ntelefon t;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 2D array `a` with 4 rows and 24 columns.

For each price, we check if we have enough books for prize I. If so, we store that price. Then, we continue iterating downwards, looking for a price for prize II (strictly less than prize I's price and enough books). We repeat for prize III.\n3. **Efficiency:** This approach is efficient because we iterate through the possible prices only once, and the frequency counting is done in O(number of books), which is acceptable given the constraints.\n\n### Answer a\nThe algorithm's efficiency comes from two main parts:\n\n1.  **Frequency Counting:** We count the occurrences of each price in the input. This takes O(N) time, where N is the number of books.\n2.  **Iterating through Prices:** We iterate through the possible prices (from 1000 down to 10) at most once.  For each price, we check if there are enough books available (using the pre-computed frequencies). This takes O(M) time, where M is the range of possible prices (which is a constant, 1000 - 10 = 990).\n\nThe overall time complexity is O(N + M), which is effectively O(N) since N (up to 10^6) is much larger than M (990).  This is efficient for the given constraints. We use constant extra space for storing the three prize values and the frequency array (of size 1001).\n\n### Answer b\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n1, n2, n3;\n    cin >> n1 >> n2 >> n3;\n\n    vector<int> freq(1001, 0); // Frequencies of prices from 0 to 1000\n    int price;\n    while (cin >> price) {\n        freq[price]++;\n    }\n\n    int prize1 = -1, prize2 = -1, prize3 = -1;\n    int count1 = 0, count2 = 0, count3 = 0;\n\n    for (int p = 1000; p >= 10; --p) {\n        if (prize1 == -1) {\n            count1 += freq[p];\n            if (count1 >= n1) {\n                prize1 = p;\n            }\n        } else if (prize2 == -1 && p < prize1) {\n            count2 += freq[p];\n            if (count2 >= n2) {\n                prize2 = p;\n            }\n        } else if (prize3 == -1 && p < prize2) {\n            count3 += freq[p];\n            if (count3 >= n3) {\n                prize3 = p;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 != -1) {\n        cout << prize1 << \" \" << prize2 << \" \" << prize3 << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

The root node has parent 0.\nA leaf node is a node that has no children, meaning it doesn't appear as a parent in the vector.\n\nLet's identify which nodes are parents:\n- Node 4 is parent to nodes 2 and 5\n- Node 5 is parent to node 10\n- Node 6 is parent to nodes 3 and 9\n- Node 7 is parent to nodes 1, 4, and 6\n- Node 9 is parent to node 8\n\nSo nodes 1, 2, 3, 8, 10 are not parents to any node, making them leaf nodes.\n\n### Answer\nThere are 5 leaf nodes in the tree, so the correct answer is b. 5.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a graph with 5 vertices (piețe/markets) where one vertex is connected directly to the other four.

    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.4": "Okay, here are the solutions for each exercise, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks for the maximum value of the expression `x % 2024`, where `x` is a natural number in the range [0, 10^9). The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe maximum remainder when dividing by a number `n` is `n-1`. This occurs when the dividend is one less than a multiple of `n`.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of `x % 2024` is 2024 - 1 = 2023.  Therefore, the correct answer is **c. 2023**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given three functions, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, and we need to determine which of them produce the same result when called with `n = 24`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each function for n=24:\n\n*   **f1(24):**  `24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 24 * 25 / 2 = 12 * 25 = 300`\n*   **f2(24):** This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.  It's equivalent to f1.  `f2(24) = 24 + 23 + ... + 1 = 300`\n*   **f3(24):**\n    *   `n` is even, so `24 * 24 / 4 + 2 * f3(12) = 144 + 2 * f3(12)`\n    *   `f3(12) = 12 * 12 / 4 + 2 * f3(6) = 36 + 2 * f3(6)`\n    *   `f3(6) = 6 * 6 / 4 + 2 * f3(3) = 9 + 2 * f3(3)`\n    *   `f3(3) = 3 + f3(2)`\n    *   `f3(2) = 2 * 2 / 4 + 2 * f3(1) = 1 + 2 * f3(1)`\n    *   `f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `f3(2) = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3`\n    *   `f3(3) = 3 + 3 = 6`\n    *   `f3(6) = 9 + 2 * 6 = 21`\n    *   `f3(12) = 36 + 2 * 21 = 78`\n    *   `f3(24) = 144 + 2 * 78 = 144 + 156 = 300`\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions return 300 when n=24. Therefore, the correct answer is **d. f1, f2 și f3**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem describes a backtracking algorithm that generates combinations of four ingredients for a baked dish, subject to certain constraints. We need to find the seventh generated combination.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will list the combinations, following the rules:\n\n1.  **No cauliflower and broccoli together:** If either is present, it's first.\n2.  **Parsley is last:** If present, it's the last ingredient.\n3.  **Cream before cheese:** If both are present, cream comes before cheese.\n\nLet's generate the combinations:\n\n1.  (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2.  (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3.  (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4.  (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5.  (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n6.  (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n7.  (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)\n\n### Answer\nThe seventh generated combination is (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval). Therefore, the correct answer is **a. (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nGiven a parent vector representing a tree with 10 nodes, we need to find the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA leaf node is a node that does not appear as a parent of any other node. We can count the number of nodes that are *not* parents. The root is indicated by 0 in the parent vector.\n\n### Answer\nThe parent vector is (7,4,6,7,4,6,7,0,9,6).\nNodes that appear as parents: 7, 4, 6, 9, 5.\nTotal nodes: 10 (1 to 10)\nParent nodes: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 (6 distinct nodes). The 0 represents the root, so we do not count it as a leaf.\nThe nodes that are not parents are 1, 2, 3, 8, 10. There are 5 such nodes.\nTherefore, there are 5 leaf nodes. The correct answer is **b. 5**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets, one connected to all others. We need to add the minimum number of bidirectional transport lanes to make the resulting graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have even degree. Initially, one market (vertex) has degree 4, and the other four markets have degree 1.\n\n### Answer\nThe central market already has an even degree (4). The other four markets have an odd degree (1).  To make the graph Eulerian, we need to make the degree of each of these four vertices even. We can achieve this by connecting them in pairs. This requires adding 2 edges. Therefore, the correct answer is **b. 2**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm reads `n` numbers. For each number `x`, it removes digits from the right as long as the last digit is less than or equal to the second-to-last digit.  It sums the resulting `x` values into `m`. Finally, it compares `m` to `n`.\n\n### a. Solution Approach\nWe will trace the algorithm's execution with the given input.\n\n### a. Answer\n*   n = 4\n*   m = 0\n*   i = 4\n    *   x = 721.  x becomes 72, then 7. m = 7. i = 3\n    *   x = 20020. x becomes 2002, then 200, then 20, then 2. m = 7 + 2 = 9. i = 2\n    *   x = 1321. x becomes 132, then 13. m = 9 + 13 = 22. i = 1\n    *   x = 211. x becomes 21. m = 22 + 21 = 43. i = 0\n*   m (43) != n (4), so the output is 43.\n\n### b. Solution Approach\nWe need to find a set of distinct numbers in [10, 10^4] such that the sum of the processed numbers equals 2, given that n=2.\n\n### b. Answer\nSince n = 2, we need two numbers.  The sum of the processed numbers must be 2.  We can choose two numbers that reduce to 1. For example, 10 and 11.\n10 -> 1\n11 -> 1\n1 + 1 = 2, which is equal to n. So, the set {10, 11} works. Another option is {100, 19}.\n\n### c.

The prices must be strictly decreasing, and for each prize, the highest possible price with enough books available should be selected.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and the book prices.\n2.  Count the frequency of each price using an array (or map).\n3.  Iterate through the prices in decreasing order.\n4.  For each prize (I, II, III), find the highest price with a sufficient count.\n5.  If three prices are found, print them; otherwise, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### a. Answer\nThe algorithm's efficiency comes from using a frequency array to count the occurrences of each price. This allows us to find the suitable prices in a single pass through the possible price range (10 to 1000), making the time complexity O(max\\_price - min\\_price + N), where N is the number of books, which is significantly better than sorting. Since the range of prices is limited, the dominant factor is O(N).\n\n### b.

Se cere numărul minim de benzi adăugate pentru ca graful să devină eulerian (toate nodurile de grad par).\n\n### Solution Approach\nÎn starea iniţială:\n– Nodul central: grad 4 (par).\n– Celelalte 4 noduri: grad 1 (impar).\nPentru a transforma nodurile cu grad impar în grade pare, legăm câte două dintre ele cu o bandă nouă (un arc adăugat creşte cu 1 grad pentru fiecare din cele două noduri selectate). Astfel, din cele 4 noduri impare se formează 2 perechi; deci se adaugă 2 benzi.\n\n### Answer\nb. 2\n\n### Code Solution (if needed)\nNu este necesar codul pentru această întrebare.\n\n────────────────────────────\n## Subject II – Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nAvem un algoritm dat în pseudocod ce citeşte un număr natural n, apoi parcurge n iteraţii citind un număr x la fiecare pas, efectuează o buclă interioară în care se “taie” ultimele cifre ale lui x până când condiţia x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 nu mai este adevărată, iar la final se acumulează valoarea obţinută în m.

The maximum possible value for this expression would be 2024-1 = 2023, which occurs when x is one less than a multiple of 2024.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of the expression `x%2024` is 2023, which corresponds to option c.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine which of the three functions f1, f2, and f3 return the same value when n=24.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's calculate the value returned by each function for n=24:\n\n1. f1(24) = 24*(24+1)/2 = 24*25/2 = 600/2 = 300\n2. f2(24) is a recursive sum from 1 to 24: 24 + 23 + 22 + ... + 1 + 0 = 300\n3. f3(24) requires tracing the recursive calls:\n   - f3(24) = 24*24/4 + 2*f3(12) = 144 + 2*f3(12)\n   - f3(12) = 12*12/4 + 2*f3(6) = 36 + 2*f3(6)\n   - f3(6) = 6*6/4 + 2*f3(3) = 9 + 2*f3(3)\n   - f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + 2*2/4 + 2*f3(1) = 3 + 1 + 2*f3(1)\n   - f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n   - Working backward: f3(3) = 3 + 1 + 2*1 = 6\n   - f3(6) = 9 + 2*6 = 21\n   - f3(12) = 36 + 2*21 = 78\n   - f3(24) = 144 + 2*78 = 300\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions return 300 for n=24, so the answer is d. f1, f2 and f3.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the 7th dish generated using backtracking, given the constraints and the first 5 dishes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n1. Broccoli and cauliflower cannot be in the same dish, and if one is used, it must be placed first\n2. If parsley is used, it must be placed last\n3. If sour cream and cheese are used together, sour cream must be placed before cheese\n\nThe first 5 dishes are:\n1. (broccoli, cheese, egg, parsley)\n2. (broccoli, egg, cheese, parsley)\n3. (broccoli, egg, sour cream, cheese)\n4. (broccoli, egg, sour cream, parsley)\n5. (broccoli, sour cream, cheese, egg)\n\nThe 6th dish would be:\n6. (broccoli, sour cream, egg, parsley)\n\nAnd the 7th dish would be:\n7. (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel) = (cauliflower, cheese, egg, parsley)\n\n### Answer\nThe 7th dish is (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel), which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the number of leaf nodes in a tree represented by a \"parent\" vector.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe parent vector is (7,4,6,7,4,7,0,9,6,5), where index i represents node i+1 and the value represents its parent.\nFor example, node 1's parent is 7, node 2's parent is 4, etc.\n\nA leaf node is one that doesn't have any children, meaning it doesn't appear as a parent in the vector.\nLet's count which nodes (1-10) appear as parents in the vector:\n- Node 4 appears twice (as parent of nodes 2 and 5)\n- Node 5 appears once (as parent of node 10)\n- Node 6 appears twice (as parent of nodes 3 and 9)\n- Node 7 appears three times (as parent of nodes 1, 4, and 6)\n- Node 9 appears once (as parent of node 8)\n\nSo nodes 1, 2, 3, 8, and 10 don't appear as parents, making them leaf nodes.\n\n### Answer\nThe number of leaf nodes is 5, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a graph with 5 nodes (markets), where one node is directly connected to the other four. We need to determine how many bidirectional edges must be added to make the graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all vertices have even degree.\n\nCurrently, we have:\n- One node with degree 4 (connected to all other nodes)\n- Four nodes with degree 1 (each connected only to the central node)\n\nTo make all vertices have even degree:\n- The central node already has even degree (4)\n- The four peripheral nodes need to increase their degree from 1 to an even number (at least 2)\n\nThe most efficient way is to connect the peripheral nodes in pairs, requiring 2 additional edges.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of bidirectional edges that need to be added is 2, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm that processes a sequence of numbers and determine its output for specific inputs.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe algorithm reads a number n, then reads n numbers. For each number x, it repeatedly divides by 10 until the last digit is greater than the second-to-last digit. Then it adds this modified number to a sum m. Finally, it compares m with n.\n\na) For the input 4, 721, 20020, 1321, 211:\n- n = 4\n- For x = 721: Last digit (1) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2), so x becomes 72. Last digit (2) ≤ Second-to-last digit (7), so x becomes 7. m = 0 + 7 = 7.\n- For x = 20020: Last digit (0) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2), so x becomes 2002. Last digit (2) ≤ Second-to-last digit (0), no change. Last digit (0) ≤ Second-to-last digit (0), no change. Last digit (0) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2), so x becomes 2. m = 7 + 2 = 9.\n- For x = 1321: Last digit (1) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2), so x becomes 132. Last digit (2) ≤ Second-to-last digit (3), so x becomes 13. Last digit (3) > Second-to-last digit (1), no further change. m = 9 + 13 = 22.\n- For x = 211: Last digit (1) ≤ Second-to-last digit (1), so x becomes 21. Last digit (1) ≤ Second-to-last digit (2), so x becomes 2. m = 22 + 2 = 24.\n- Since m = 24 and n = 4, m ≠ n, so the output is 24.\n\nb) For n = 2, we need two numbers that sum to 2 after processing. The simplest solution would be 10 and 10, as each would be reduced to 1 after processing, and 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nc) C++ program:\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m = 0, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    i = n;\n    \n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    \n    if (m != n)\n        cout << m;\n    else\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd) Algorithm with for loop:\n```\ncitește n (număr natural nenul)\nm0\npentru i←n, 1, -1 execută\n    citește x (număr natural)\n    cât timp x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 execută\n        x[x/10]\n    m←m+x\ndacă m≠n atunci scrie m\naltfel scrie „egal\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a structure for a phone with specific fields and declare a variable of this type.\n\n### Solution Approach\nBased on the expressions `t.producator`, `t.dimensiune[0]`, and `t.frecventa`, we need to create a structure with fields for manufacturer, processor frequency, and dimensions.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3]; // width, thickness, length in mm\n};\n\ntelefon t;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write code to display the indices of columns where both the first and last elements are 2024.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll iterate through all columns and check if both a[0][j] and a[3][j] are equal to 2024.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\nfor(i = 0; i < 24; i++)\n    if(a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024)\n        cout << i << \" \";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function that returns the product of all common divisors of two natural numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, then find all divisors of the GCD and multiply them.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\nint produs(int a, int b) {\n    // Find GCD using Euclidean algorithm\n    int gcd = a;\n    while(b) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = gcd % b;\n        gcd = temp;\n    }\n    \n    // Find all divisors of GCD and multiply them\n    int result = 1;\n    for(int i = 1; i <= gcd; i++) {\n        if(gcd % i == 0) {\n            result *= i;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to read a number n and a text, then display words with fewer than n letters on one line and words with more than n letters on another line.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll parse the text word by word, checking the length of each word and placing it in the appropriate category.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    char text[101];\n    bool hasShort = false, hasLong = false;\n    \n    cin >> n;\n    cin.ignore(); // Ignore the newline after n\n    cin.getline(text, 101);\n    \n    char *word = strtok(text, \" \");\n    \n    // First line: words with fewer than n letters\n    while(word != NULL) {\n        if(strlen(word) < n) {\n            cout << word << \" \";\n            hasShort = true;\n        }\n        word = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n    \n    if(!hasShort) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n    \n    // Reset for second pass\n    word = strtok(text, \" \");\n    \n    // Second line: words with more than n letters\n    while(word != NULL) {\n        if(strlen(word) > n) {\n            cout << word << \" \";\n            hasLong = true;\n        }\n        word = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n    \n    if(!hasLong) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the prices of books for three prizes, where each prize has a specific number of winners, and the prices must be in strictly decreasing order.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Count the frequency of each price in the available books\n2. Sort the prices in descending order\n3. For each prize, find the highest price with enough books available\n\na. Algorithm description:\n1. Read n1, n2, n3 (number of winners for each prize)\n2. Read all book prices and count their frequencies\n3. Sort unique prices in descending order\n4.

    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.6": "Okay, here are the solutions for each exercise, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks for the maximum value of the expression `x % 2024`, where `x` is a natural number in the range [0, 10^9). The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe maximum remainder when dividing by a number `n` is `n-1`. This occurs when the dividend is one less than a multiple of `n`.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of `x % 2024` is `2024 - 1 = 2023`. Therefore, the correct answer is **c. 2023**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have three functions, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, and we need to determine which of them return the same value when called with `n = 24`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each function for `n = 24`:\n\n*   **f1(24):**  `24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 24 * 25 / 2 = 12 * 25 = 300`\n*   **f2(24):** This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.  It's equivalent to `n * (n + 1) / 2`.  So, `f2(24) = 24 * (24 + 1) / 2 = 300`.\n*   **f3(24):**\n    *   Since 24 is even, `f3(24) = 24 * 24 / 4 + 2 * f3(12) = 144 + 2 * f3(12)`\n    *   `f3(12) = 12 * 12 / 4 + 2 * f3(6) = 36 + 2 * f3(6)`\n    *   `f3(6) = 6 * 6 / 4 + 2 * f3(3) = 9 + 2 * f3(3)`\n    *   `f3(3) = 3 + f3(2)`\n    *   `f3(2) = 2 * 2 / 4 + 2 * f3(1) = 1 + 2 * f3(1)`\n    *   `f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `f3(2) = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3`\n    *   `f3(3) = 3 + 3 = 6`\n    *   `f3(6) = 9 + 2 * 6 = 21`\n    *   `f3(12) = 36 + 2 * 21 = 78`\n    *   `f3(24) = 144 + 2 * 78 = 144 + 156 = 300`\n\n### Answer\nAll three functions, `f1(24)`, `f2(24)`, and `f3(24)`, return the value 300. Therefore, the correct answer is **d. f1, f2 și f3**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed, but here's the C++ code from the problem):\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint f1(int n) {\n    return n * (n + 1) / 2;\n}\n\nint f3(int n) {\n    if (n == 0) return 0;\n    if (n % 2 == 1) return n + f3(n - 1);\n    return n * n / 4 + 2 * f3(n / 2);\n}\n\nint f2(int n) {\n    if (n != 0) return n + f2(n - 1);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout << f1(24) << \" \" << f2(24) << \" \" << f3(24) << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis problem involves generating combinations of ingredients for oven-baked dishes using backtracking, subject to specific constraints. We need to identify the seventh generated combination.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will follow the backtracking algorithm, applying the given rules:\n\n1.  **No cauliflower and broccoli together:** If either is used, it's placed first.\n2.  **Parsley last:** If parsley is used, it's placed last.\n3.  **Sour cream before cheese:** If both are used, sour cream comes before cheese.\n\nLet's list the combinations systematically:\n\n1.  (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2.  (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3.  (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4.  (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5.  (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n6.  (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n7.  (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)\n8.  (broccoli, smantana, ou, patrunjel)\n9. (conopida, cascaval, ou, patrunjel)\n...\n\n### Answer\nThe seventh generated combination is (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval). The correct answer is **a. (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not strictly needed, as we can derive the answer by manual backtracking)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a tree represented by a parent vector (also known as a \"father\" vector), and we need to find the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA leaf node is a node that has no children. In a parent vector representation, a node is a leaf if its index does not appear in the parent vector.\n\n### Answer\nLet's analyze the parent vector: `(7, 4, 6, 7, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5)`\n\n*   Node 1: Parent is 7\n*   Node 2: Parent is 4\n*   Node 3: Parent is 6\n*   Node 4: Parent is 7\n*   Node 5: Parent is 4\n*   Node 6: Parent is 7\n*   Node 7: Parent is 0 (Root)\n*   Node 8: Parent is 9\n*   Node 9: Parent is 6\n*   Node 10: Parent is 5\n\nThe nodes that appear as parents are: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. The nodes that *do not* appear as parents are 1, 2, 3, 8, and 10.  These are the leaf nodes.  There are 5 leaf nodes. Therefore the answer is **b. 5**\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets (nodes), with one market connected to all others.  We need to add the minimum number of bidirectional transport bands (edges) to make the resulting graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have even degree (number of edges connected to them).  Initially, we have one node with degree 4, and four nodes with degree 1.\n\n### Answer\n*   The central market (connected to all others) has degree 4 (even).\n*   The other four markets each have degree 1 (odd).\n\nTo make the graph Eulerian, we need to make the degree of all nodes even. We can connect the four odd-degree nodes in pairs. This requires adding two edges.  After adding these edges, all nodes will have even degree. Therefore, the answer is **b. 2**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis problem involves analyzing an algorithm given in pseudocode, determining its output for given inputs, finding inputs that produce a specific output, and translating the algorithm into C++ and an equivalent pseudocode using a different loop structure.\n\n### a.

Input for \"egal\" when n = 2\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe need to find two numbers such that the sum of their processed values (`m`) equals 2.

The `dimensiune` member will be an array of three floats.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3];\n};\n\nint main() {\n    telefon t;\n\n    // Example usage (not required by the problem, but good practice)\n    t.producator = 'A';\n    t.frecventa = 2800;\n    t.dimensiune[0] = 75.5;  // Width\n    t.dimensiune[1] = 8.2;   // Thickness\n    t.dimensiune[2] = 160.1; // Length\n\n    std::cout << \"Producator: \" << t.producator << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Frecventa: \" << t.frecventa << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Latime: \" << t.dimensiune[0] << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 2D array `a` with 4 rows and 24 columns. We need to print the indices of the columns where both the first and last elements are equal to 2024.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will iterate through the columns (from 0 to 23). For each column, we will check if `a[0][i]` and `a[3][i]` are both equal to 2024. If they are, we print the column index `i`.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int a[4][24]; // Assuming the array is declared\n\n    //For the sake of demonstration let's fill the array, this is not asked in the exercise\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < 24; j++) {\n            a[i][j] = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    a[0][2] = 2024;\n    a[3][2] = 2024;\n    a[0][5] = 2024;\n    a[3][5] = 2024;\n    a[0][10] = 2024;\n    a[1][10] = 2024; // this should not be printed\n    a[3][10] = 2024;\n\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 24; ++i) {\n        if (a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024) {\n            std::cout << i << \" \";\n        }\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function `produs` that takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the product of their common divisors.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.

For each number `i`, check if it's a divisor of the GCD.\n4.  If `i` is a divisor, multiply the `product` by `i`.  Also, if `GCD / i` is different from `i`, multiply `product` by `GCD / i` (to account for the paired divisor).\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n    while (b) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nlong long produs(int a, int b) {\n    int commonDivisor = gcd(a, b);\n    long long product = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i * i <= commonDivisor; ++i) {\n        if (commonDivisor % i == 0) {\n            product *= i;\n            if (i * i != commonDivisor) {\n                product *= (commonDivisor / i);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return product;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout << produs(20, 12) << std::endl; // Output: 8\n    std::cout << produs(15, 25) << std::endl; // Output: 5\n    std::cout << produs(18, 24) << std::endl; // Output: 36\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a string of words (lowercase, distinct, space-separated) and an integer `n`.

Iterate through the text, splitting it into words.\n3.  For each word, get its length.\n4.  If the length is less than `n`, append it to a string for short words.\n5.  If the length is greater than `n`, append it to a string for long words.\n6.  After processing all words, print the short words string (or \"nu exista\").\n7.

We also have a list of book prices. We need to find the highest prices for each prize such that they are strictly decreasing and we have enough books of each price. If no such prices exist, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and the book prices from the file.\n2.  Create a frequency array (or map) to count the occurrences of each price.\n3.  Iterate downwards from the maximum possible price (1000) to find the price for Prize I.\n4.  Once Prize I price is found, iterate downwards from `PrizeI_price - 1` to find Prize II.\n5.  Once Prize II price is found, iterate downwards from `PrizeII_price - 1` to find Prize III.\n6. If at any point we can't find a suitable price for the needed quantity, we output \"nu exista\".\n\n### a. Algorithm Description and Efficiency Justification\n\nThe algorithm reads the input and counts the frequency of each price. The time complexity of this part is O(N), where N is the number of books.\nThen we iterate at most three times through a range of possible prices, which is a constant range [10, 1000], making it O(1) in complexity.\nThe total time complexity of the algorithm is O(N) making it a linear time algorithm.\nThe space complexity is O(1) because the frequency map has a maximum size of 1000 - 10 = 990, which is constant.\n\n### b.

Conopidă and broccoli cannot be used together, and if one is used, it must be first\n2. If pătrunjel is used, it must be last\n3. If smântână and cașcaval are used together, smântână must come before cașcaval\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's track the generation sequence based on the first five dishes provided:\n1. (broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n2. (broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n3. (broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval)\n4. (broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel)\n5. (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou)\n\nThe 6th dish would be: (broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, pătrunjel)\n\nFor the 7th dish, we've exhausted all combinations starting with broccoli, so we move to conopidă:\n7. (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n\n### Answer\nThe 7th generated dish is (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel), which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the number of leaf nodes in a tree represented by a \"father\" vector (7,4,6,7,0,4,7,9,6,5).\n\n### Solution Approach\nIn this representation, the value at position i is the parent of node i+1. A leaf node is one that doesn't appear as a parent in the vector.\n\nLet's identify which nodes are parents:\n- Node 4 is parent to nodes 2 and 6\n- Node 5 is parent to node 10\n- Node 6 is parent to nodes 3 and 9\n- Node 7 is parent to nodes 1, 4, and 6\n- Node 9 is parent to node 8\n\nSo nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are parents. The total number of nodes is 10, so the number of leaf nodes is 10 - 5 = 5.\n\n### Answer\nThe number of leaf nodes is 5, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets, with one market directly connected to the other four by bidirectional transport bands. We need to determine the minimum number of additional bidirectional bands needed to make the graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all vertices have even degree. Currently, we have:\n- One vertex with degree 4 (connected to all others)\n- Four vertices with degree 1 (each connected only to the central vertex)\n\nTo make all vertices have even degree, we need to add edges between the vertices with degree 1.\nWe need to increase the degree of each of these four vertices by 1, which requires adding 4/2 = 2 edges.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of additional bidirectional bands needed is 2, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm that processes a sequence of numbers, and answer questions about its behavior.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe algorithm:\n1. Reads a number n\n2. Initializes m to 0 and i to n\n3. While i ≥ 1:\n   - Reads a number x\n   - While the last digit of x is less than or equal to the second-to-last digit, removes the last digit\n   - Adds x to m and decrements i\n4. Compares m with n and outputs accordingly\n\na) For the input 4, 721, 20020, 1321, 211:\n   - n = 4, m = 0, i = 4\n   - Read x = 721\n     - Last digit 1 ≤ second-to-last digit 2? No, so x remains 721\n     - m = 0 + 721 = 721, i = 3\n   - Read x = 20020\n     - Last digit 0 ≤ second-to-last digit 2? Yes, so x = 2002\n     - Last digit 2 ≤ second-to-last digit 0? No, so x remains 2002\n     - m = 721 + 2002 = 2723, i = 2\n   - Read x = 1321\n     - Last digit 1 ≤ second-to-last digit 2? Yes, so x = 132\n     - Last digit 2 ≤ second-to-last digit 3? Yes, so x = 13\n     - Last digit 3 ≤ second-to-last digit 1? No, so x remains 13\n     - m = 2723 + 13 = 2736, i = 1\n   - Read x = 211\n     - Last digit 1 ≤ second-to-last digit 1? Yes, so x = 21\n     - Last digit 1 ≤ second-to-last digit 2? Yes, so x = 2\n     - m = 2736 + 2 = 2738, i = 0\n   - Since m = 2738 ≠ n = 4, output is 2738\n\nb) If n = 2, we need m = 2 at the end. We can choose two numbers that will be processed to give a sum of 2.\n   For example: 10 and 2\n   - For x = 10, the last digit 0 ≤ second-to-last digit 1, so x becomes 1\n   - For x = 2, it remains 2\n   - m = 1 + 2 = 3 ≠ n = 2, so this doesn't work\n\n   Let's try: 10 and 1\n   - For x = 10, the last digit 0 ≤ second-to-last digit 1, so x becomes 1\n   - For x = 1, it remains 1\n   - m = 1 + 1 = 2 = n, so this works\n\nc) C++ program:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m = 0, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    i = n;\n    \n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m += x;\n        i--;\n    }\n    \n    if (m != n) {\n        cout << m;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd) Algorithm with for loop:\n```\ncitește n (număr natural nenul)\nm0\npentru i←n, 1, -1 execută\n    citește x (număr natural)\n    cât timp x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 execută\n        x[x/10]\n    \n    mm+x\n\ndacă m≠n atunci scrie m\naltfel scrie „egal\"\n```\n\n### Answer\na) 2738\nb) 10 and 1 (or any other pair of numbers that will give m = 2)\nc) See C++ program above\nd) See modified algorithm above\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a structure for a phone with the specified fields and declare a variable of this type.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe structure needs to have:\n- A character field for the manufacturer\n- An integer field for the processor frequency\n- An array of 3 real numbers for the dimensions (width, thickness, length)\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3]; // [0]-width, [1]-thickness, [2]-length\n};\n\ntelefon t;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to display the indices of columns where both the first and last elements are equal to 2024.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll iterate through all columns (0 to 23) and check if both a[0][j] and a[3][j] are equal to 2024.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nfor(i = 0; i < 24; i++)\n    if(a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024)\n        cout << i << \" \";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function that returns the product of all common divisors of two natural numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.

We need n1 books for Prize I, n2 for Prize II, and n3 for Prize III\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Count the frequency of each price in the input\n2. Sort the distinct prices in descending order\n3. For each prize type, find the highest price with enough remaining books\n\na) Algorithm description:\n1. Read n1, n2, n3 from the file\n2. Read all the prices and count their frequencies using a map or array\n3. Sort the distinct prices in descending order\n4. For Prize I: Find the highest price with frequency ≥ n1\n5.

In the parent vector representation, a node `i` is a leaf if its value does not appear in the parent vector.  We will iterate through the parent vector and count how many nodes are *not* parents.\n\n### Answer\nThe parent vector is `(7, 4, 6, 7, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5)`. The root is indicated by 0. The nodes are 1 to 10.\nLet's check which nodes are parents:\n- 1's parent is 7\n- 2's parent is 4\n- 3's parent is 6\n- 4's parent is 7\n- 5's parent is 4\n- 6's parent is 7\n- 7's parent is 0 (root)\n- 8's parent is 9\n- 9's parent is 6\n- 10's parent is 5\n\nThe parent nodes are {7, 4, 6, 9, 5}. The nodes which are *not* present in this set are {1, 2, 3, 8, 10}, excluding the root, which is not a leaf.  So we have five numbers representing leaf nodes.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **b. 5**.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets (nodes), with one market connected to all others.  We need to add the minimum number of bidirectional transport bands (edges) to make the resulting undirected graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nAn undirected graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have even degree.  Currently, one node has degree 4, and the other four nodes have degree 1.  We need to make all degrees even.\n\n*   The central market (connected to all others) already has an even degree (4).\n*   The other four markets each have an odd degree (1).\n\nTo make the degrees of the four markets even, we can add edges between them in pairs. We need to add two edges in total.\n\n### Answer\nWe need to add 2 edges. Therefore, the answer is **b. 2**.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis problem involves analyzing and rewriting a given pseudocode algorithm. The algorithm processes a sequence of numbers and performs calculations based on the digits of each number.\n\n### Solution Approach\n**a.** We will trace the algorithm with the given input.\n**b.** We will devise a set of numbers that will cause the algorithm to output \"egal\".\n**c.** We will translate the pseudocode to C++.\n**d.** We will modify the pseudocode to use a \"for\" loop.\n\n### Answer\n\n**a.**\n*   n = 4\n*   m = 0\n*   i = 4\n    *   x = 721.  Inner loop: x becomes 72, then 7.  m = 0 + 7 = 7. i = 3\n    *   x = 20020. Inner loop: x becomes 2002, then 200, then 20, then 2. m = 7 + 2 = 9. i = 2\n    *   x = 1321. Inner loop: x becomes 132, then 13, then 1. m = 9 + 1 = 10. i = 1\n    *   x = 211. Inner loop: x becomes 21, then 2. m = 10 + 2 = 12. i = 0\n*   m (12) != n (4). Output: 12\n\n**b.**\n*   n = 2\n*   m = 0\n*   i = 2\nWe want m to be equal to n (2) at the end. Let's choose two numbers that, after the inner loop, sum up to 2.\n*   Choose x = 10. Inner loop: 10 -> 1.\n*   Choose x = 10. Inner loop: 10 -> 1.\n\nAfter the first iteration, m will be 1, i = 1.\nAfter the second iteration, m will be 1 + 1 = 2, i=0.\nm (2) == n (2), which will print \"egal\"\nSo, a possible set of numbers is 10, 10. Other possible set of numbers are {11,10}, {12, 1010}.\nThe numbers must be distinct. So, the set {10, 11} will fulfill the requirements.\n\n**c.**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    m = 0;\n    i = n;\n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    if (m != n) {\n        cout << m;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**d.**\n\n```pseudocode\ncitește n (număr natural nenul)\nm0\npentru in,1,-1 execută\n    citește x (număr natural)\n    cât timp x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 execută\n        x[x/10]\n    sfârșit cât timp\n    mm+x\nsfârșit pentru\ndacă m≠n atunci scrie m\naltfel scrie „egal”\nsfârșit dacă\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a C++ structure to store information about a phone, including its producer (a character), processor frequency (an integer), and dimensions (three floats).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll use the `struct` keyword to define the structure, including the specified members.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nstruct telefon {\n    char producator;\n    int frecventa;\n    float dimensiune[3]; // Or: float latime, grosime, lungime;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    telefon t;\n  \n    // Example usage (not required by the problem, but good practice)\n    t.producator = 'S';\n    t.frecventa = 2800;\n    t.dimensiune[0] = 70.5;  // latime\n    t.dimensiune[1] = 8.2;   // grosime\n    t.dimensiune[2] = 150.1; // lungime\n    \n    // Accessing values\n    std::cout << \"Producator: \" << t.producator << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Latime: \" << t.dimensiune[0] << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Frecventa: \" << t.frecventa << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nGiven a 2D array `a` with 4 rows and 24 columns, we need to print the indices of the columns where the first and last elements are equal to 2024.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll iterate through the columns of the array and check the condition `a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024` for each column `i`.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int a[4][24];\n     //The elements should be initialized.\n    // For testing purposes, let's initialize some columns to meet the requirement.\n    for(int j=0; j<24; ++j){\n        for(int i=0; i<4; ++i){\n            a[i][j] = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    a[0][2] = 2024;\n    a[3][2] = 2024;\n\n    a[0][5] = 2024;\n    a[3][5] = 2024;\n\n    a[0][10] = 2024;\n    a[3][10] = 10; //This column will not be printed\n\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 24; i++) {\n        if (a[0][i] == 2024 && a[3][i] == 2024) {\n            cout << i << \" \";\n        }\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe `produs` subprogram needs to calculate the product of the common divisors of two given numbers, `a` and `b`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.  We can use the Euclidean algorithm for this.  The common divisors of `a` and `b` are the divisors of their GCD.\n2.  Iterate from 1 up to the square root of the GCD.

We need to read an integer `n` and then classify the words in the text based on their length: words shorter than `n` and words longer than `n`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Read the text.\n3.  Iterate through the text, extracting each word.  A simple way to do this is to use `stringstream`.\n4.

We need to find the highest prices for each prize category such that the prices are strictly decreasing and there are enough books of each price.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n1`, `n2`, `n3`.\n2.  Read the book prices into a frequency array (since prices are in the range \\[10, 10^3], we can use an array of size 1001).\n3.  Iterate through the prices in decreasing order (from 1000 down to 10).\n4.  Keep track of the prices found for each prize category.\n5.  For each price, check if there are enough books available for the current prize category. If so, assign the price to that category and decrement the available books for that price, then move to the next category.\n6. If we find prices for the three categories then output the three prices. Otherwise, output \"nu exista\".\n\n### Answer\n\n**a.**\nThe algorithm's efficiency comes from using a frequency array to store the counts of each book price.  This allows us to avoid sorting the prices, which would take O(n log n) time.  Instead, we iterate through the possible prices (a constant range of 10 to 1000) and check the frequency array, which takes O(1) time for each price.  The overall time complexity is O(1) (constant), because the range of the prices is limited from 10 to 1000, and the main loop is executed 1000-10 times.\n\n**b.**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n1, n2, n3;\n    cin >> n1 >> n2 >> n3;\n\n    vector<int> freq(1001, 0);\n    int price;\n    while (cin >> price) {\n        freq[price]++;\n    }\n\n    int prize1 = -1, prize2 = -1, prize3 = -1;\n    int category = 1; \n\n    for (int p = 1000; p >= 10; --p) {\n        if (category == 1 && freq[p] >= n1) {\n            prize1 = p;\n            freq[p] -= n1;\n            category = 2;\n        } else if (category == 2 && freq[p] >= n2) {\n            prize2 = p;\n            freq[p] -= n2;\n            category = 3;\n        } else if (category == 3 && freq[p] >= n3) {\n            prize3 = p;\n            break; // All prizes found\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (prize1 != -1 && prize2 != -1 && prize3 != -1) {\n        cout << prize1 << \" \" << prize2 << \" \" << prize3 << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

Let's compute it step by step:\n  - For n=24 (even): f3(24) = 24²/4 + 2*f3(12) = 144 + 2*f3(12)\n  - For n=12 (even): f3(12) = 12²/4 + 2*f3(6) = 36 + 2*f3(6)\n  - For n=6 (even): f3(6) = 6²/4 + 2*f3(3) = 9 + 2*f3(3)\n  - For n=3 (odd): f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + [2²/4 + 2*f3(1)] = 3 + [1 + 2*f3(1)]\n  - For n=1 (odd): f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n  - Working backward: f3(3) = 3 + [1 + 2*1] = 3 + 3 = 6\n  - f3(6) = 9 + 2*6 = 21\n  - f3(12) = 36 + 2*21 = 78\n  - f3(24) = 144 + 2*78 = 300\n\n### Answer\nf1(24) = 300, f2(24) = 300, and f3(24) = 300. Therefore, all three functions return the same value, which corresponds to option d.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe're using backtracking to generate all ways to prepare dishes using 4 distinct ingredients from {broccoli, cașcaval, conopidă, ou, pătrunjel, smântână} with specific constraints:\n1. Conopidă and broccoli can't be used together, and if one is used, it must be first\n2. If pătrunjel is used, it must be last\n3. If smântână and cașcaval are used together, smântână must come before cașcaval\n\nThe first five dishes are given, and we need to find the seventh dish.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the given dishes and continue the generation to find the seventh one:\n1.

We need to determine the number of leaf nodes in this tree.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA leaf node is a node that has no children. To identify leaf nodes, we need to find which nodes never appear as parents in the given vector.\n\nLet's map the parent vector:\n- Node 1 has parent 7\n- Node 2 has parent 4\n- Node 3 has parent 6\n- Node 4 has parent 7\n- Node 5 has parent 4\n- Node 6 has parent 7\n- Node 7 has parent 0 (root)\n- Node 8 has parent 9\n- Node 9 has parent 6\n- Node 10 has parent 5\n\nNow, let's count which nodes are children of each node:\n- Node 1: no children\n- Node 2: no children\n- Node 3: no children\n- Node 4: has children 2, 5\n- Node 5: has child 10\n- Node 6: has children 3, 9\n- Node 7: has children 1, 4, 6\n- Node 8: no children\n- Node 9: has child 8\n- Node 10: no children\n\nTherefore, the leaf nodes are 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, for a total of 5 leaf nodes.\n\n### Answer\nThe number of leaf nodes is 5, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets in a city, with one market directly connected to the other four via bidirectional transport bands. We need to determine the minimum number of additional bidirectional bands required to make the graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if all its vertices have even degrees. In our case, we have one vertex with degree 4 (connected to all others) and four vertices with degree 1 each (only connected to the central vertex).\n\nTo make the graph Eulerian, we need to add edges so that all vertices have even degrees. The central vertex already has an even degree (4), but the other four vertices have odd degrees (1 each). We need to add edges between these four vertices to make their degrees even.\n\nThe minimum number of edges to add would be 2, connecting the four vertices in pairs.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of bidirectional bands to add is 2, which corresponds to option b.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm and answer several questions about its behavior.\n\nThe algorithm reads a number n, then reads n numbers.

The maximum value for an expression `x%n` is `n-1`, which occurs when `x` is congruent to `n-1` modulo `n`.\n\n### Answer\nThe maximum value of x%2024 is 2023, which occurs when x = 2023, 4047, 6071, etc.\n\nThe correct answer is c. 2023\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine which of the three functions `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` return the same value when called with n=24.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's calculate what each function returns with n=24:\n\n1. f1(n) = n*(n+1)/2 \n   - f1(24) = 24*(24+1)/2 = 24*25/2 = 600/2 = 300\n\n2. f2(n) is a recursive function that adds n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n   - f2(24) = 24 + 23 + 22 + ... + 1 = 300\n\n3. f3(n) is a more complex recursive function:\n   - For odd n: n + f3(n-1)\n   - For even n: n²/4 + 2*f3(n/2)\n   - Let's calculate f3(24):\n     - f3(24) = 24²/4 + 2*f3(12) = 144 + 2*f3(12)\n     - f3(12) = 12²/4 + 2*f3(6) = 36 + 2*f3(6)\n     - f3(6) = 6²/4 + 2*f3(3) = 9 + 2*f3(3)\n     - f3(3) = 3 + f3(2) = 3 + (2²/4 + 2*f3(1)) = 3 + 1 + 2*f3(1)\n     - f3(1) = 1 + f3(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n     - So, f3(3) = 3 + 1 + 2*1 = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6\n     - f3(6) = 9 + 2*6 = 9 + 12 = 21\n     - f3(12) = 36 + 2*21 = 36 + 42 = 78\n     - f3(24) = 144 + 2*78 = 144 + 156 = 300\n\n### Answer\nFor n=24, all three functions return the value 300.\n\nThe correct answer is d. f1, f2 și f3\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify the 7th dish generated using backtracking, following specific rules for placing ingredients in a baking pan.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the rules:\n1. Cauliflower and broccoli can't be used together; if one is used, it must be placed first.\n2. If parsley is used, it must be placed last.\n3. If sour cream and cheese are used together, sour cream must be placed before cheese.\n\nWe're given the first 5 dishes generated:\n1. (broccoli, cheese, egg, parsley)\n2. (broccoli, egg, cheese, parsley)\n3. (broccoli, egg, sour cream, cheese)\n4. (broccoli, egg, sour cream, parsley)\n5. (broccoli, sour cream, cheese, egg)\n\nLet's continue the generation to find the 6th and 7th dishes:\n- The 6th dish would be (broccoli, sour cream, egg, parsley)\n- The 7th dish would be (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel) [cauliflower, cheese, egg, parsley]\n\n### Answer\nThe 7th dish generated is (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel).\n\nThe correct answer is b. (conopidă, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the number of leaf nodes in a tree represented by a \"parents\" vector.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA leaf node is a node that has no children. In a parents vector representation, a node is a leaf if it doesn't appear as a parent for any other node.\n\nGiven the parents vector (7,4,6,7,4,7,0,9,6,5), we need to count which nodes (1 to 10) don't appear in this vector.\n\nLet's check each node:\n- Node 1 is not a parent of any node\n- Node 2 is not a parent of any node\n- Node 3 is not a parent of any node\n- Node 8 is not a parent of any node\n- Node 10 is not a parent of any node\n\nThese 5 nodes (1, 2, 3, 8, 10) are the leaf nodes.\n\n### Answer\nThe number of leaf nodes in the tree is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is b. 5\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have 5 markets in a city, and one of them is directly connected to the other four via bidirectional transport routes. We need to find the minimum number of bidirectional routes that need to be added so that the resulting undirected graph is Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if all its vertices have an even degree. In our current configuration, one market has a degree of 4 (connected to all others), while the other four markets each have a degree of 1.\n\nTo make all vertices have even degree, we need to add edges to those vertices with odd degree. Since we have 4 vertices with odd degree (degree 1), we need to add at least 2 edges to make all degrees even.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of bidirectional routes to add is 2.\n\nThe correct answer is b. 2\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm given in pseudocode, determine its output for specific inputs, find inputs to produce a specific output, convert it to C++, and rewrite it with a different loop structure.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe algorithm reads a natural number n, then n other natural numbers. It processes each number by repeatedly dividing it by 10 until the current last digit is greater than the new last digit. It sums these processed numbers to get m, and outputs either m or \"egal\" if m equals n.\n\n#### Part a. Output for the given inputs\nFor the inputs 4, 721, 20020, 1321, 211:\n- n = 4\n- For 721: 721%10 = 1, [721/10]%10 = 2. Since 1 ≤ 2, we get x = [721/10] = 72\n  Checking again: 72%10 = 2, [72/10]%10 = 7. Since 2 ≤ 7, we get x = [72/10] = 7\n  Now, m = 0 + 7 = 7\n- For 20020: 20020%10 = 0, [20020/10]%10 = 2. Since 0 ≤ 2, we get x = [20020/10] = 2002\n  Continue until we get x = 2, so m = 7 + 2 = 9\n- For 1321: 1321%10 = 1, [1321/10]%10 = 2. Since 1 ≤ 2, we get x = [1321/10] = 132\n  Continue until we get x = 1, so m = 9 + 1 = 10\n- For 211: 211%10 = 1, [211/10]%10 = 1. Since 1 = 1 (not <), we keep x = 211\n  So m = 10 + 211 = 221\n- Since m = 221 ≠ n = 4, we output 221\n\n#### Part b. Input for \"egal\" output\nIf n = 2, we need m = 2. This means the sum of processed numbers should be 2.\nOne possibility: 1 and 1\nAnother possibility: 2 and any number that reduces to 0\n\n#### Part c. C++ implementation\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m = 0, i, x;\n    \n    cin >> n;\n    i = n;\n    \n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        \n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        \n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    \n    if (m != n) {\n        cout << m;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n#### Part d.

We need to identify the seventh generated combination.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll list the combinations, following the rules strictly:\n\n1.  **broccoli, cașcaval, ou, pătrunjel**\n2.  **broccoli, ou, cașcaval, pătrunjel**\n3.  **broccoli, ou, smântână, cașcaval**\n4.  **broccoli, ou, smântână, pătrunjel**\n5.  **broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, ou**\n6.  **broccoli, smântână, cașcaval, pătrunjel**\n7. **broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel**\n\n### Answer\nThe seventh generated combination is **(broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel)**.  Therefore, the correct answer is **a. (broccoli, smântână, ou, cașcaval)** is wrong, it does not respect the order. b is wrong, because conopida and brocoli cannot stay together. The good response is **none of the above answers, because it is (broccoli, smântână, ou, pătrunjel)**.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe're given a tree represented by a \"parent\" vector and need to determine the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA leaf node is a node that doesn't have any children. In the \"parent\" vector representation, a node is a leaf if its index does not appear in the parent vector's values (except for 0, the value of the root's parent).\n\n### Answer\nThe parent vector is (7, 4, 6, 7, 4, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5).  The nodes are numbered 1 to 10.\n\n*   1's parent is 7\n*   2's parent is 4\n*   3's parent is 6\n*   4's parent is 7\n*   5's parent is 4\n*   6's parent is 7\n*   7's parent is 0 (root)\n*   8's parent is 9\n*   9's parent is 6\n*   10's parent is 5\n\nThe nodes that appear as parents are: 7, 4, 6, 9, 5.\nThe nodes that do NOT appear as parents (and are therefore leaves) are: 1, 2, 3, 8, and 10.\nThere are 5 leaf nodes.\nThe correct response is b. 5.\n\n### Code Solution (not needed)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a scenario with 5 markets, one of which is connected to the other four.  We need to find the minimum number of additional bidirectional transport bands to make the resulting graph Eulerian.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA graph is Eulerian if and only if all its vertices have an even degree (number of edges connected to them).\nInitially, the graph has one node with degree 4 and four nodes with degree 1.\n\nTo make all nodes have even degree, we need to add edges to make the degree of each node even:\n\nInitial Degrees: 4, 1, 1, 1, 1\nConnect two nodes of degree 1: 4, 2, 2, 1, 1\nConnect other two nodes of degree 1: 4, 2, 2, 2, 2.\nSo, it has become eulerian after adding two bidirectional bands.\n### Answer\nWe need to add 2 bidirectional bands. The correct answer is **b. 2**.\n\n### Code Solution (not needed)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm reads a number `n`, then reads `n` more numbers. For each of these `n` numbers, it removes digits from the right as long as the last digit is less than or equal to the second-to-last digit.  Finally, it sums the resulting numbers and compares the sum to `n`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the algorithm step by step.\n\n**a.**\n*   n = 4\n*   x = 721.  `x % 10 = 1`, `[x / 10] % 10 = 2`.  1 <= 2. x becomes 72. `x % 10 = 2`, `[x/10]%10=7`. 2<=7. x becomes 7. m = 7\n*   x = 20020. `x % 10 = 0`, `[x / 10] % 10 = 2`. 0 <= 2. x becomes 2002. `x % 10 = 2`, `[x / 10] % 10 = 0`. 2 > 0. Loop stops. m = 7 + 2002 = 2009\n*   x = 1321. `x % 10 = 1`, `[x / 10] % 10 = 2`. 1 <= 2. x becomes 132. `x % 10 = 2`, `[x / 10] % 10 = 3`. 2 <= 3, x becomes 13. `x%10=3`, `[x/10]%10=1`. 3>1. Loop stops. m = 2009 + 13 = 2022\n*   x = 211. `x % 10 = 1`, `[x / 10] % 10 = 1`. 1 <= 1. x becomes 21.  `x % 10 = 1`, `[x / 10] % 10 = 2`. 1 <= 2. x becomes 2. m = 2022 + 2 = 2024\n*   m (2024) != n (4). Output: 2024\n\n**b.**\n*   n = 2\n* We want to provide two different x, belonging to the [10,10000] range.\n* The final sum of the processed values of the two x-es must be 2.\n* It results the two x-es must be processed to become 1 and 1.\n* Ex: 19, 19.  After processing, both values become 1. So, the final value is 1 + 1 = 2 which equals n.  We must use distinct values.\n\n**c.**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m, i, x;\n    cin >> n;\n    m = 0;\n    i = n;\n    while (i >= 1) {\n        cin >> x;\n        while (x % 10 <= (x / 10) % 10) {\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        m = m + x;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    if (m != n) {\n        cout << m;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"egal\";\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**d.**\n\n```pseudocode\ncitește n (număr natural nenul)\nm <- 0\npentru i <- n, 1, -1 execută\n    citește x (număr natural)\n    cât timp x%10 ≤ [x/10]%10 execută\n        x <- [x/10]\n    sfârșit cât timp\n    m <- m + x\nsfârșit pentru\ndacă m ≠ n atunci\n    scrie m\naltfel\n    scrie „egal”\nsfârșit dacă\n```\n\n### Answer\na. 2024\nb. 19 18\nc.

Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.\n2.  Iterate through numbers from 1 to the square root of the GCD.\n3.  For each number, check if it's a divisor of the GCD.\n4.  If it is, multiply it into the product.\n5. If the divisor*divisor != GCD, then we identified another divisor, the GCD/divisor, and we must include it too.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint produs(int a, int b) {\n    int gcd = 1;\n    // Find GCD (Euclid's algorithm)\n    int temp_a = a;\n    int temp_b = b;\n    while (temp_b) {\n        int r = temp_a % temp_b;\n        temp_a = temp_b;\n        temp_b = r;\n    }\n    gcd = temp_a;\n\n    long long product = 1; // Use long long to avoid potential overflow\n    for (int i = 1; i * i <= gcd; i++) {\n        if (gcd % i == 0) {\n            product *= i;\n            if (i * i != gcd) {\n                product *= (gcd / i);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return product;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cout << produs(20, 12) << endl; // Output: 8\n    cout << produs(24,36) << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks to read a number `n` and a text containing distinct words separated by spaces. The program should output the words with length less than `n` on one line and the words with length greater than `n` on another line. If a category is empty, output \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Read the text.\n3.  Iterate through the text, word by word.\n4.  For each word, determine its length.\n5.  If the length is less than `n`, append it to a string for short words.\n6.  If the length is greater than `n`, append it to a string for long words.\n7.

We need to find the highest prices for each prize such that the prices are strictly decreasing and there are enough books of each price.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and the book prices.\n2.  Create a frequency array (or map) to count the occurrences of each price.\n3.  Iterate from the highest possible price (1000) down to the lowest (10).\n4.  Maintain three variables to store the prices for prizes I, II, and III.\n5.  For each price, check if there are enough books for the current prize level. If so and all superior prizes are set, assign the price and decrement the frequency.\n6. The complexity is O(M + N) where N is the number of books, and M the range where the values are stored (10-1000). It is very effective.\n\n### Answer\n\n**a. Algorithm Description and Justification**\n\nThe algorithm works by counting the frequency of each book price using an array.  Then, it iterates downward from the maximum possible price (1000) to find suitable prices for each prize. It prioritizes finding the price for Prize I first, then Prize II, and finally Prize III, ensuring the strictly decreasing order.  It's efficient because it uses a frequency array for counting (O(N) to build, where N is the number of books) and then iterates through possible prices (at most 1000 iterations), which is a constant factor relative to the potential input size of 10^6. The total time complexity is O(N + M), where M is the range of price (which is fixed 10-1000). It is far better than sorting, which will bring complexity to O(NlogN).\n\n**b.
