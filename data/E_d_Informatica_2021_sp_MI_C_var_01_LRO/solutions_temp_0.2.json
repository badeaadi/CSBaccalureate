Among the given options:\n- Option (d) `x%2==y%2` checks if both numbers have the same parity, but does not ensure both are even.\n- Option (c) `(x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0` ensures both numbers are even because both their sum and difference must be even, which is only possible if both are even.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is: **c. (x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the values of `n` and `c` such that the function `f(n, c)` returns a specific value based on the given recursive function.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function `f` processes the digits of `n` recursively, removing digits equal to `c`. It returns the number formed by digits not equal to `c`. We need to analyze each option:\n- Option (a) `n=2021` and `c=0`: No zeros to remove, returns 2021.\n- Option (b) `n=200211` and `c=2`: Removes all 2s, returns 011 or 11.\n- Option (c) `n=312032` and `c=3`: Removes all 3s, returns 1202.\n- Option (d) `n=720721` and `c=7`: Removes all 7s, returns 2021.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct values are: **d. n=720721 și c=7**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to access an element on the secondary diagonal of a 100x100 matrix `m`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe secondary diagonal of a matrix is defined by the condition `i + j = n - 1` for an `n x n` matrix. For a 100x100 matrix, `i + j = 99`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is: **d. m[42][57]** (since 42 + 57 = 99)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify an elementary cycle in the given undirected graph.\n\n### Solution Approach\nAn elementary cycle is a closed path where no vertex is repeated except the starting and ending vertex. Analyze the given graph:\n- Option (a) `1,2,3` is not closed.\n- Option (b) `1,2,3,1` is closed and elementary.\n- Option (c) `1,2,3,4,5,3,1` is closed but not elementary.\n- Option (d) `1,2,3,4,5,6,1` is closed but not elementary.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct cycle is: **b. 1,2,3,1**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the minimum number of nodes at level 3 in a tree where all nodes at the same level have an equal number of children and different levels have different numbers of nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor level 3, the number of nodes must be a product of the number of children per node at previous levels. Assume the root has `k` children, level 1 has `k` nodes, level 2 has `k^2` nodes, and level 3 has `k^3` nodes. The smallest `k` that satisfies different numbers of nodes at each level is `k=2`.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of nodes at level 3 is: **a. 12**\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the given pseudocode algorithm and provide outputs based on specific inputs, rewrite it in C++, and convert the loop structure.\n\n### Solution Approach\n#### Part (a)\nFor `x=8` and `y=5`, after swapping, `x=5` and `y=8`. The loop runs from 8 to 5, decrementing by 1, printing `1` and `2` based on the condition.\n\n#### Part (b)\nFor `x=10`, we need `y` values such that `2` is printed three times. This happens when `nr` becomes greater or equal to `x` three times.\n\n#### Part (c)\nConvert the pseudocode to C++.\n\n#### Part (d)\nRewrite using a `while` loop with initial test.\n\n### Answer\n#### Part (a)\nOutput: `1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1`\n\n#### Part (b)\nPossible values for `y`: **13, 14**\n\n#### Part (c)\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y;\n    cin >> x >> y;\n    if (x > y) {\n        int temp = x;\n        x = y;\n        y = temp;\n    }\n    int nr = 1;\n    for (int i = y; i >= x; --i) {\n        cout << \"1 \";\n        if (nr >= x) {\n            cout << \"2 \";\n        }\n        nr *= 3;\n        cout << \"1 \";\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n#### Part (d)\n### Pseudocode\n```\nread x, y\nif x > y then swap x, y\nnr <- 1\ni <- y\nwhile i >= x do\n    write 1\n    if nr >= x then\n        write 2\n    end if\n    nr <- nr * 3\n    write 1\n    i <- i - 1\nend while\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to generate groups of singing birds using backtracking, ensuring \"mierla\" and \"privighetoare\" are not in the same group.\n\n### Solution Approach\nGenerate combinations of birds, ensuring constraints are met.

This approach is efficient in terms of memory and execution time, as it processes each number only once and uses constant space for tracking the last two valid numbers.",
    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.2": "Okay, here are the solutions for each exercise, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks for a C/C++ expression that evaluates to 1 if and only if both integer variables `x` and `y` are even numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA number is even if it's divisible by 2, meaning the remainder of the division by 2 is 0. We can use the modulo operator (`%`) to check for this. We need to ensure *both* `x` and `y` satisfy this condition.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is `x % 2 == 0 && y % 2 == 0`. This checks if both `x` and `y` have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.\n\n### Code Solution (Not strictly needed, but clarifies the concept)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int x = 4;\n    int y = 6;\n    int result = (x % 2 == 0 && y % 2 == 0); // result will be 1\n    std::cout << result << std::endl;\n\n    x = 5;\n    y = 8;\n    result = (x % 2 == 0 && y % 2 == 0); // result will be 0\n    std::cout << result << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThe correct answer is **d. x%2==y%2** because if x and y are both even or both odd, the expression will be true. If one is even and the other is odd, the expression will be false. The question asks for an expression that is true *only* when x and y are even. However, option d is the closest to the correct answer and the other options are incorrect. The best answer would have been `x % 2 == 0 && y % 2 == 0`.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a recursive function `f(n, c)` and need to find values for `n` and `c` such that the function returns 2021. The function processes the digits of `n` from right to left. If a digit equals `c`, it's skipped. Otherwise, the digit is added to 10 times the result of the recursive call with the remaining digits.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the function's behavior:\n\n-   `if (n == 0) return 0;`: Base case: if `n` is 0, return 0.\n-   `if (n % 10 == c) return f(n / 10, c);`: If the last digit of `n` is equal to `c`, the function recurses with `n` without its last digit, effectively ignoring the digit `c`.\n-   `else return n % 10 + 10 * f(n / 10, c);`: If the last digit of `n` is *not* equal to `c`, the function adds the last digit to 10 times the result of the recursive call.\n\nWe need to find `n` and `c` such that `f(n, c)` returns 2021. We'll test the given options.\n\n### Answer\n\n*   **a. n=2021 și c=0:**  f(2021, 0) = 1 + 10 * f(202, 0) = 1 + 10 * (2 + 10 * f(20,0)) = 1 + 10 * (2 + 10 * (2 + 10 * f(2,0))) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*(2 + 10*(2))) = 2221.\n*   **b. n=200211 și c=2:** f(200211, 2) = 1 + 10*f(20021,2) = 1 + 10*(1+10*f(2002,2)) = 1 + 10*(1+10*(0+10*f(200,2))) = 1 + 10*(1+10*(0+10*(0+10*f(20,2)))) = 1 + 10*(1+10*(0+10*(0+10*(0 + 10*f(2,2))))) = 1 + 10*(1+10*(0+10*(0+10*(0 + 10*0)))) = 11.\n*   **c. n=312032 și c=3:** f(312032, 3) = 2 + 10*f(31203,3) = 2 + 10*(0 + 10*f(3120,3)) = 2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2 + 10*f(312,3))) = 2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2 + 10*(1 + 10*f(31,3))))= 2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2 + 10*(1 + 10*(1+10*f(3,3))))) = 2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2 + 10*(1 + 10*(1+10*0)))) = 11202\n*   **d. n=720721 și c=7:** f(720721, 7) = 1 + 10*f(72072,7) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*f(7207,7)) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*(0 + 10*f(720,7))) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2 + 10*f(72,7)))) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2 + 10*(0 + 10*f(7,7))))) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2 + 10*(0 + 10*0)))) = 2021\n\nThe correct answer is **d. n=720721 și c=7**.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 2D array `m` with 100 rows and 100 columns (indexed from 0 to 99). We need to find the C/C++ expression to access an element on the secondary diagonal.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe secondary diagonal of a square matrix consists of elements where the sum of the row index and column index is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of rows/columns.  In this case, `n = 100`.  So, for an element on the secondary diagonal, `row_index + col_index = 99`.  Given a row index of 42, the corresponding column index on the secondary diagonal would be `99 - 42 = 57`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is `m[42][57]`.\n\n### Code Solution (Illustrative)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int m[100][100];\n    // Accessing an element on the secondary diagonal:\n    m[42][57] = 10; // Example assignment\n    std::cout << m[42][57] << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThe correct answer is **d. m[42][57]**.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given an undirected graph with 6 nodes and a list of edges. We need to identify an elementary cycle within the graph. An elementary cycle is a cycle where no node is visited more than once (except for the start/end node).\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's list the edges:\n[1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5], [5,6]\n\nWe'll examine each option:\n\n*   **a. 1,2,3:**  This is a path, not a cycle.\n*   **b. 1,2,3,1:** This is a cycle.  Edges [1,2], [2,3], and [3,1] exist. It's elementary.\n*   **c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1:** This is a cycle, but it's *not* elementary because node 3 is visited twice.\n*   **d. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1:** This is a cycle. Let's check the edges: [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], [5,6]. We need an edge [6,1] to close the cycle, which is not present.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct elementary cycle is **b. 1,2,3,1**.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a rooted tree where nodes on the same level have the same number of children, and no two levels have the same number of nodes. We need to find the minimum number of nodes on level 3.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children of nodes at level `i` as `c_i`.\n- Level 0: 1 node (the root).\n- Level 1: `c_0` nodes.\n- Level 2: `c_0 * c_1` nodes.\n- Level 3: `c_0 * c_1 * c_2` nodes.\n\nWe need to minimize the number of nodes on level 3, subject to the constraints:\n1.  `c_i` must be a positive integer (at least 1).\n2.  The number of nodes on each level must be different.\n\nLet's try different values for `c_0`, `c_1`, and `c_2`, keeping them as small as possible:\n\n- If `c_0 = 1`, then Level 1 has 1 node. This is not allowed since Level 0 also has 1 node.\n- If `c_0 = 2`, Level 1 has 2 nodes.\n    - If `c_1 = 1`, Level 2 has 2 nodes (not allowed).\n    - If `c_1 = 3`, Level 2 has 6 nodes.\n        - If `c_2 = 1`, Level 3 has 6 nodes (not allowed).\n        - If `c_2 = 2`, Level 3 has 12 nodes. This is a valid configuration.\n- If `c_0 = 3`, Level 1 has 3 nodes.\n    - If `c_1 = 1`, Level 2 has 3 nodes. This is not allowed.\n    - If `c_1 = 2`, level 2 has 6 nodes.\n        - If `c_2 = 1`, level 3 has 6 nodes. This is not allowed.\n        - If `c_2 = 4`, level 3 has 24 nodes.\n\nThe minimum number of nodes is achieved with `c_0 = 2`, `c_1 = 3`, and `c_2 = 1`. However, the number of nodes at each level must be different. So we must choose a different value for `c_2`. The next smallest value is 2.\nLevel 0: 1 node\nLevel 1: 2 nodes\nLevel 2: 2 * 3 = 6 nodes\nLevel 3: 2 * 3 * 1 = 6. This is not allowed.\nLevel 3: 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 nodes.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of nodes on level 3 is 12. The correct answer is **a. 12**.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe pseudocode algorithm swaps `x` and `y` if `x > y`, then iterates from `y` down to `x` (inclusive if x and y were swapped, otherwise exclusive), printing '1' in each iteration. Inside the loop, it checks if `nr` (initialized to 1) is greater than or equal to `x`. If it is, it prints '2'.  `nr` is multiplied by 3 in each iteration.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll trace the algorithm for the given inputs and then find inputs that satisfy the condition in part (b).\n\n### Answer\n**a.**  `x = 8`, `y = 5`.\n1.  `x > y` is true, so `x` becomes 5 and `y` becomes 8.\n2.  `nr = 1`.\n3.  Loop from `i = 8` down to `5`:\n    -   `i = 8`: prints '1'. `nr` (1) is not >= `x` (5). `nr` becomes 3. prints '1'.\n    -   `i = 7`: prints '1'. `nr` (3) is not >= `x` (5). `nr` becomes 9. prints '1'.\n    -   `i = 6`: prints '1'. `nr` (9) is >= `x` (5). prints '2'. `nr` becomes 27. prints '1'.\n    -   `i = 5`: prints '1'. `nr` (27) is >= `x` (5). prints '2'. `nr` becomes 81. prints '1'.\n\nOutput: `1111121121`\n\n**b.** `x = 10`. We want the digit '2' to be printed exactly three times.  This means `nr` must be >= 10 three times during the loop.  `nr` takes values 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ...  We need the loop to run at least 4 times for 2 to be printed 3 times.\n\nLet's try `y = 13`. The loop runs from 13 down to 11.\n- i = 13: 1, nr = 3, 1\n- i = 12: 1, nr = 9, 1\n- i = 11: 1, nr = 27, 2, 1\nOnly one 2 is printed.\n\nLet's try y = 7. The loop runs from 7 to 10. x and y are not swapped.\n- i = 7: 1, nr = 3, 1\n- i = 6: 1, nr = 9, 1\n- i = 5: 1, nr = 27, 2, 1\n- i = 4: 1, nr = 81, 2, 1\n- i = 3: 1, nr = 243, 2, 1\nThree 2's are printed.\n\nLet's try y = 8. The loop runs from 8 to 10. x and y are not swapped.\n- i = 8: 1, nr = 3, 1\n- i = 7: 1, nr = 9, 1\n- i = 6: 1, nr = 27, 2, 1\n- i = 5: 1, nr = 81, 2, 1\n- i = 4: 1, nr = 243, 2, 1\nThree 2's are printed.\n\nTwo possible values for `y` are 7 and 8.\n\n**c.** C++ Code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y, nr, i;\n    std::cin >> x >> y;\n\n    if (x > y) {\n        int temp = x;\n        x = y;\n        y = temp;\n    }\n\n    nr = 1;\n    for (i = y; i >= x; i--) {\n        std::cout << 1;\n        if (nr >= x) {\n            std::cout << 2;\n        }\n        nr *= 3;\n        std::cout << 1;\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**d.** Pseudocode with `while` loop:\n\n```\ncitește x,y\n (numere naturale nenule)\n┌dacă x>y atunci\n│ aux <- x\n│ x <- y\n│ y <- aux\n└■\nnr <- 1\ni <- y\n┌cât timp i >= x execută\n│ scrie 1\n│┌dacă nr >= x atunci\n││ scrie 2\n│└■\n│ nr <- nr * 3\n│ scrie 1\n│ i <- i - 1\n└■\n```\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are using backtracking to generate combinations of at least two birds from a given set, with the constraint that \"mierla\" and \"privighetoare\" cannot be in the same group. We are given the first four solutions and need to provide the next two after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll follow the backtracking order, keeping in mind the constraint:\n\n1.  **cinteză, ciocârlie**\n2.  **cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă**\n3.  **cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu**\n4.  **cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare**\n5.  **cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu**\n6.  **cinteză, ciocârlie, scatiu**\n7.  **cinteză, mierlă**\n8.  **cinteză, mierlă, scatiu**\n9.  **cinteză, privighetoare**\n10. **cinteză, privighetoare, scatiu**\n11. **cinteză, scatiu**\n12. **ciocârlie, mierlă**\n13. **ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu**\n14. **ciocârlie, privighetoare**\n15. **ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu**\n16. **ciocârlie, scatiu**\n17. **mierlă, scatiu**\n18. **privighetoare, scatiu**\n19. **scatiu**\n\n### Answer\nThe two solutions immediately after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu) are: (ciocârlie, scatiu) and (mierlă, scatiu).\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a `struct` named `fractie` with members `a` (numerator) and `b` (denominator).  Variables `f` and `fs` store fractions. We need to store in `fs` the result of subtracting the fraction in `f` from 2020/2021, *without* using additional variables.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe subtraction of two fractions (a/b) from (c/d) is calculated as (c\\*b - a\\*d) / (b\\*d).  We can directly apply this formula to the members of `f` and `fs`.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nfs.a = 2020 * f.b - f.a * 2021;\nfs.b = 2021 * f.b;\n```\n\n### Code Solution (Complete, for context)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nstruct fractie {\n    int a, b;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    fractie f, fs;\n\n    // Example values for f (you can read these from input)\n    f.a = 2;\n    f.b = 5;\n\n    // Calculate fs = 2020/2021 - f\n    fs.a = 2020 * f.b - f.a * 2021;\n    fs.b = 2021 * f.b;\n\n    std::cout << \"Resulting fraction (fs): \" << fs.a << \"/\" << fs.b << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function `divPrim(n, s)` that calculates the sum (`s`) of the prime divisors of `n` that appear with an odd power in the prime factorization of `n`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Iterate through potential divisors `d` from 2 up to the square root of `n`.\n2.  For each `d`, check if it's a divisor of `n`.\n3.  If `d` is a divisor, determine its power in the factorization of `n`.\n4.  If the power is odd and the divisor is prime, add it to the sum `s`.\n5.  After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 1, it means `n` itself is a prime factor (with a power of 1, which is odd), so add it to `s`.\n\n### Code Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid divPrim(int n, int& s) {\n    s = 0;\n    int d = 2;\n    while (d * d <= n) {\n        int power = 0;\n        while (n % d == 0) {\n            power++;\n            n /= d;\n        }\n        if (power % 2 != 0) {\n            s += d;\n        }\n        d++;\n    }\n    if (n > 1) {\n        s += n;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n = 360;\n    int s;\n    divPrim(n, s);\n    std::cout << \"s = \" << s << std::endl; // Output: s = 7\n\n    n = 16;\n    divPrim(n, s);\n    std::cout << \"s = \" << s << std::endl; // Output: s = 0\n\n    n = 2*3*3*5*5*5;\n    divPrim(n,s);\n    std::cout << \"s = \" << s << std::endl; // Output: s = 7\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe program reads `n` words and an integer `k`. It needs to display the first `k` words that end with a vowel, or \"nu exista\" if there are fewer than `k` such words.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the words one by one.\n3.  For each word, check if its last character is a vowel.\n4.  If it is, print the word and decrement `k`.\n5.  If `k` reaches 0, stop.\n6.  After reading all words, if `k` is still greater than 0, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Code Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nbool isVowel(char c) {\n    return (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u');\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    std::cin >> n >> k;\n    std::cin.ignore(); // Consume the newline after reading k\n\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        std::string word;\n        std::getline(std::cin, word); // Read the entire word, including spaces if any\n\n        if (!word.empty() && isVowel(word.back())) {\n            std::cout << word << std::endl;\n            count++;\n            if (count == k) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (count < k) {\n        std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe program reads a number `x` and a sequence of numbers from a file. It needs to find the last two consecutive numbers in the sequence that have `x` as a suffix.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `x` from the first line of the file.\n2.  Read numbers from the second line one by one.\n3.  Keep track of the two most recent numbers that have `x` as a suffix (`last1` and `last2`).\n4.  A number `num` has `x` as a suffix if `num == x` or `num % (10^digits(x)) == x`.\n5.  If two such numbers are found, print them and stop.\n6.  If the end of the file is reached and two such numbers haven't been found, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Code Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nbool isSuffix(int num, int x) {\n    if (num == x) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    int powerOf10 = 1;\n    int tempX = x;\n    while(tempX > 0){\n        powerOf10 *= 10;\n        tempX /= 10;\n    }\n\n    return (num % powerOf10 == x);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream file(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x;\n    file >> x;\n\n    int num;\n    int last1 = -1, last2 = -1;\n    int current, previous = -1;\n\n    while (file >> num) {\n        current = num;\n        if (isSuffix(current, x)) {\n            if(last1 == -1){\n                last1 = current;\n            } else {\n                last2 = last1;\n                last1 = current;\n            }\n        }\n      previous = current;\n    }\n\n    if (last2 != -1) {\n        std::cout << last2 << \" \" << last1 << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    file.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**a. Algorithm Description and Justification:**\n\nThe algorithm reads the value of `x` and then iterates through the numbers in the file. It maintains two variables, `last1` and `last2`, to store the last two numbers found that have `x` as a suffix. The `isSuffix` function efficiently checks if a number is a suffix of another by using the modulo operator.  This avoids string conversions, making it efficient in terms of time. The algorithm uses only a few integer variables, regardless of the number of inputs, making it efficient in terms of memory.  It reads the file only once, which is optimal for time complexity.\n",
    "solutions_anthropicclaude37sonnet_0.2": "# Computer Science Exam Solutions\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find which expression correctly identifies when both integers x and y are even numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor a number to be even, it must be divisible by 2, which means the remainder when divided by 2 is 0.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\na. `x%2==0 && (y+1)%2!=0` - This checks if x is even AND y+1 is odd. If y+1 is odd, then y must be even.\nb. `(x-y)/2==0` - This checks if (x-y) is 0 or 1 (due to integer division), not if both are even.\nc. `(x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0` - This checks if both x+y and x-y are even.\nd. `x%2==y%2` - This checks if x and y have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\n### Answer\nOption c: `(x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0`\n\nIf both x and y are even, then both x+y and x-y are even.\nConversely, if x+y is even and x-y is even, then:\n- If x is even, y must be even\n- If x is odd, y must be odd\nBut since both x+y and x-y are even, x and y must both be even.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the recursive function `f(n,c)` and determine which input values will produce the output 2021.\n\n```cpp\nint f(int n,int c)\n{ \n    if(n==0) return 0;\n    else\n        if(n%10==c) return f(n/10,c);\n        else return n%10+10*f(n/10,c);\n}\n```\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function removes all occurrences of digit c from the number n. Let's trace each option:\n\na. n=2021, c=0: No 0s to remove, should return 2021\nb. n=200211, c=2: Removes all 2s, returns 0011 = 11\nc. n=312032, c=3: Removes all 3s, returns 12032\nd. n=720721, c=7: Removes all 7s, returns 20721\n\n### Answer\nOption a: n=2021 and c=0\n\nSince there are no 0s in 2021, the function will return 2021 unchanged.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify the correct expression to access an element on the secondary diagonal of a 2D array with 100 rows and 100 columns (indexed from 0 to 99).\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor a square matrix, elements on the secondary diagonal have the property that the sum of their row and column indices equals n-1, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\nIn this case, for any element [i][j] on the secondary diagonal: i + j = 99\n\n### Answer\nOption d: m[42][57]\n\nFor this element, 42 + 57 = 99, which confirms it's on the secondary diagonal.\nOptions a, b, and c don't represent valid array access syntax in C/C++.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify an elementary cycle in the given undirected graph with 6 nodes and edges [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5], [5,6].\n\n### Solution Approach\nAn elementary cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated vertices except the first/last one.\n\nLet's check each option:\na. 1,2,3 - This is not a cycle as it doesn't return to the starting point.\nb. 1,2,3,1 - This forms a cycle: 1→2→3→1\nc. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1 - This repeats vertex 3, so it's not an elementary cycle.\nd. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1 - This is not a valid cycle as there's no edge between 6 and 1.\n\n### Answer\nOption b: 1,2,3,1\n\nThis is a valid elementary cycle as:\n- It starts and ends at the same vertex (1)\n- All edges exist in the graph: [1,2], [2,3], [1,3]\n- No vertices are repeated except the first/last one\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the minimum number of nodes at level 3 in a rooted tree where:\n- All nodes at the same level have the same number of children\n- No two different levels have the same number of nodes\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children per node at each level as:\n- Level 0 (root): has c₀ children\n- Level 1 nodes: each has c₁ children\n- Level 2 nodes: each has c₂ children\n\nThe number of nodes at each level would be:\n- Level 0: 1 node (the root)\n- Level 1: c₀ nodes\n- Level 2: c₀×c₁ nodes\n- Level 3: c₀×c₁×c₂ nodes\n\nSince no two levels can have the same number of nodes, we need to find the minimum values for c₀, c₁, and c₂ that satisfy our constraints.\n\n### Answer\nOption c: 8\n\nThe minimum configuration would be:\n- Level 0: 1 node (root)\n- Level 1: 2 nodes (c₀=2)\n- Level 2: 4 nodes (c₁=2)\n- Level 3: 8 nodes (c₂=2)\n\nThis is the minimum possible because:\n1. The root must have at least 1 child\n2. Each level must have more nodes than the previous level\n3. Using c₀=c₁=c₂=2 gives us the minimum progression that satisfies all constraints\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the given pseudocode algorithm, determine its output for specific inputs, find inputs that produce specific outputs, and convert it to C++ code.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's first understand what the algorithm does:\n1. It reads two natural numbers x and y\n2. If x > y, it swaps them (ensuring x ≤ y)\n3. It initializes nr = 1\n4. It iterates from y down to x (inclusive) with step -1\n5. For each iteration, it prints 1, then conditionally prints 2 if nr ≥ x, then multiplies nr by 3, and finally prints 1 again\n\n#### a) Output for x=8, y=5\nSince x=8 > y=5, they get swapped, so x=5 and y=8.\nThen we iterate from 8 down to 5:\n\ni=8: print 1, nr=1 < x=5 (no 2), nr=3, print 1\ni=7: print 1, nr=3 < x=5 (no 2), nr=9, print 1\ni=6: print 1, nr=9 > x=5 (print 2), nr=27, print 1\ni=5: print 1, nr=27 > x=5 (print 2), nr=81, print 1\n\nOutput: 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n#### b) For x=10, find y values where 2 is printed exactly three times\nFor each iteration, 2 is printed if nr ≥ x. Since nr starts at 1 and is multiplied by 3 each iteration, we need to find when nr will exceed 10.\nnr sequence: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, ...\nSo 2 will be printed starting from the 3rd iteration.\n\nIf y-x+1 = 3, then 2 will be printed exactly 3 times.\nIf y-x+1 = 4, then 2 will be printed exactly 4 times.\n\nFor x=10, we need y-10+1 = 3, so y = 12.\nOr y-10+1 = 4, so y = 13.\n\n### Answer\na) Output for x=8, y=5: 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nb) Two possible values for y when x=10: 12 and 13\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y, nr, i;\n    \n    // Read input\n    cin >> x >> y;\n    \n    // Swap if x > y\n    if (x > y) {\n        int temp = x;\n        x = y;\n        y = temp;\n    }\n    \n    nr = 1;\n    \n    // Iterate from y down to x\n    for (i = y; i >= x; i--) {\n        cout << \"1 \";\n        \n        if (nr >= x) {\n            cout << \"2 \";\n        }\n        \n        nr = nr * 3;\n        cout << \"1 \";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### d) Algorithm with while loop\n```\ncitește x,y\n (numere naturale nenule)\ndacă x>y atunci xy\nnr1\ni←y\ncât timp i>=x execută\n    scrie 1\n    dacă nr≥x atunci\n        scrie 2\n    nr←nr*3\n    scrie 1\n    i←i-1\n```\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the next two solutions after \"ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu\" in a backtracking sequence that generates all groups of at least two birds from the set {cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, privighetoare, scatiu}, with the constraint that mierlă and privighetoare cannot be in the same group.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's first understand the order of generation. The birds seem to be considered in this order: cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, privighetoare, scatiu.\n\nThe first four solutions are:\n1. (cinteză, ciocârlie)\n2. (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă)\n3. (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu)\n4. (cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare)\n\nWe need to find the next two solutions after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu).\n\nLooking at the pattern, we're generating combinations in lexicographic order, with the constraint that mierlă and privighetoare can't be together.\n\n### Answer\nThe next two solutions after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu) are:\n1. (cinteză, mierlă)\n2. (cinteză, mierlă, scatiu)\n\nThis follows the lexicographic ordering of combinations with the given constraint.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write code to store in variable fs the result of subtracting fraction f from fraction 2020/2021, where both f and fs are structures with fields a (numerator) and b (denominator).\n\n### Solution Approach\nTo subtract fractions, we need to:\n1. Find a common denominator\n2. Subtract the numerators\n3. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nfs.b = 2021 * f.b;  // Common denominator\nfs.a = 2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a;  // Numerator calculation\n```\n\nThis solution directly computes the result of (2020/2021) - (f.a/f.b) without simplifying the fraction.\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function divPrim that calculates the sum of prime divisors of n that appear at an odd power in its prime factorization.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Find all prime factors of n\n2. For each prime factor, determine its power in the factorization\n3. If the power is odd, add the prime factor to the sum\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nvoid divPrim(long long n, int &s) {\n    s = 0;\n    long long d = 2;\n    \n    while (n > 1) {\n        int power = 0;\n        \n        while (n % d == 0) {\n            power++;\n            n /= d;\n        }\n        \n        if (power % 2 == 1) {\n            s += d;\n        }\n        \n        if (d == 2) {\n            d = 3;\n        } else {\n            d += 2;\n        }\n        \n        // Optimization for large prime factors\n        if (d * d > n && n > 1) {\n            if (1 % 2 == 1) {  // Power is 1 for remaining prime\n                s += n;\n            }\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a program that reads n words and k, then outputs the first k words that end with a vowel, or \"nu exista\" if there aren't k such words.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read n and k\n2. Read n words one by one\n3. For each word, check if it ends with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)\n4. If it does, output it and increment a counter\n5. Stop after finding k such words or after processing all n words\n6. If fewer than k words ending with vowels were found, output \"nu exista\"\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool endsWithVowel(const string& word) {\n    if (word.empty()) return false;\n    \n    char lastChar = word[word.length() - 1];\n    return (lastChar == 'a' || lastChar == 'e' || lastChar == 'i' || \n            lastChar == 'o' || lastChar == 'u');\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    cin >> n >> k;\n    \n    int count = 0;\n    string word;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n && count < k; i++) {\n        cin >> word;\n        \n        if (endsWithVowel(word)) {\n            cout << word << endl;\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if (count < k) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the last two consecutive terms in a sequence that have a given number x as their suffix. The solution must be efficient in terms of memory and execution time.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read the number x and the sequence\n2. Keep track of the last two numbers that have x as a suffix\n3. To check if a number has x as a suffix, we can:\n   - Convert both to strings and check if one ends with the other, or\n   - Use arithmetic: a number has x as suffix if a % 10^(number of digits in x) == x\n4. Output the last two consecutive numbers that satisfy the condition, or \"nu exista\" if there aren't two such numbers\n\n### a) Algorithm Description\n1. Read x from the first line\n2. Calculate the power of 10 needed (10^number of digits in x)\n3. Initialize two variables last1 and last2 to store the last two consecutive numbers with suffix x\n4. Read each number from the sequence and check if it has x as suffix\n5. If it does, update last1 and last2, shifting last1 to last2 and storing the new number in last1\n6. After processing all numbers, check if we found at least two numbers with suffix x\n7. If yes, output last2 and last1; otherwise, output \"nu exista\"\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n- It processes each number only once (O(n) time complexity)\n- It uses constant extra space (O(1) space complexity)\n- It avoids string conversions by using arithmetic operations\n\n### b) Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x, power = 1, temp = 0;\n    \n    fin >> x;\n    \n    // Calculate 10^(number of digits in x)\n    temp = x;\n    while (temp > 0) {\n        power *= 10;\n        temp /= 10;\n    }\n    \n    long long num, last1 = -1, last2 = -1;\n    bool found = false;\n    \n    // Read each number and check for suffix\n    while (fin >> num) {\n        if (num % power == x) {\n            last2 = last1;\n            last1 = num;\n            \n            if (last2 != -1) {\n                found = true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Output result\n    if (found) {\n        cout << last2 << \" \" << last1;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```"
