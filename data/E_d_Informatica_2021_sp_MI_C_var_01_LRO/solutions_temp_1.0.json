We need these conditions applied to both `x` and `y`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is `d. x%2 == y%2`. This expression evaluates to true when both numbers are either both even or both odd, but since we're only interested in even numbers, when both are even, `x%2` is 0 which equals `y%2` when `y` is also even.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nThe subprogram `f` recursively removes all occurrences of `c` from the decimal digits of `n`. We need to determine the configuration where `f(n, c)` results in modifying the number based on the given options.\n\n### Solution Approach\nUnderstand the recursion by analyzing how `f` processes each digit of `n` sequentially from least significant to most significant.\n\n### Answer\n- a. `n=2021` and `c=0`: Result is 2021 because `0` does not exist in `2021`.\n- b. `n=200211` and `c=2`: Result is `211`.\n- c. `n=312032` and `c=3`: Result is `12`.\n- d. `n=720721` and `c=7`: Result is `20`.\n\nThe correct example that satisfies the condition is `b`.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to access elements located on the secondary diagonal of a 100x100 matrix `m`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nElements on the secondary diagonal have the property where the sum of their indices equals the size of the matrix minus one.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is `a. m[42/42]`. This seems incorrect. Correct access for secondary diagonal is typically `m[i][99-i]` for a 100x100 matrix.

The function processes the digits of `n` from right to left (least significant to most significant). If a digit equals `c`, it's skipped. Otherwise, the digit is added to 10 times the result of the recursive call with the remaining digits.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe need to analyze the function's behavior and determine how to get a specific return.

We need to identify the C/C++ expression to access an element on the secondary diagonal.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe secondary diagonal of a square matrix consists of elements where the sum of the row index and column index is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of rows (or columns). In this case, `n = 100`, so the sum of the row and column indices should be 99. For example, `m[0][99]`, `m[1][98]`, `m[99][0]` are all on the secondary diagonal. The proposed solution `m[42][57]` fits this criterion: 42 + 57 = 99.\n\n### Answer\nd. `m[42][57]`\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a graph with 6 nodes and a set of edges.  We need to find an elementary cycle in the graph. An elementary cycle is a cycle where no node is visited more than once (except for the start/end node, which is the same).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe examine the given edges and proposed cycles:\n\n*   **Edges:** [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5], [5,6]\n\n*   **a. 1,2,3:**  This is a path, not a cycle.\n*   **b. 1,2,3,1:** This is a valid cycle: 1-2, 2-3, and 3-1 are all edges in the graph. No node is repeated except the start/end.\n*   **c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1:** This is a cycle, but *not* elementary. Node 3 is repeated.\n*   **d. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1:** This is *not* a valid cycle. There is no edge [6,1].\n\n### Answer\nc. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1 is incorrect.

All nodes on the same level have the same number of children (\"fii\").\n2.  No two different levels have the same number of nodes.\nWe need to find the minimum number of nodes on level 3.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children of nodes at level `i` as `c_i`.\n*   Level 0 (root) has 1 node.\n*   Level 1 has `c_0` nodes.\n*   Level 2 has `c_0 * c_1` nodes.\n*   Level 3 has `c_0 * c_1 * c_2` nodes.\n\nWe need to minimize `c_0 * c_1 * c_2` such that:\n*   `c_i` are integers greater than or equal to 0. If any c_i is 0, then all levels below will also have 0, due to multiplication.\n*   `1`, `c_0`, `c_0 * c_1`, and `c_0 * c_1 * c_2` are all distinct.\n\nTo minimize the number of nodes on level 3, we should choose the smallest possible distinct values for the `c_i`.\n    *  c_0 cannot be 1 (otherwise levels 0 and 1 will be the same number of nodes).\n    * Let c_0 = 2\n    *  c_1 cannot be 1 (level 2 would then have same #nodes).\n    *  If c_1 = 2, we get 1, 2, 4, 8.  These number of nodes at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3, are unique.\n\n### Answer\nc. 8\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe pseudocode algorithm takes two natural numbers, `x` and `y`, swaps them if `x > y`, initializes `nr` to 1, and then iterates downwards from `y` to `x`. Inside the loop, it prints '1', then prints '2' if `nr` is greater than or equal to `x`, and finally multiplies `nr` by 3 and prints another '1'.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll trace the algorithm for the given inputs and then find suitable `y` values for the second part.\n\n**(a)**\n\n*   Input: x = 8, y = 5\n*   Swap: x = 5, y = 8\n*   nr = 1\n*   Loop from i = 8 down to 5:\n    *   i = 8:  Prints 1.  nr (1) < x (5), so no 2. nr = 3. Prints 1.\n    *   i = 7:  Prints 1.  nr (3) < x (5), so no 2. nr = 9. Prints 1.\n    *   i = 6:  Prints 1.  nr (9) >= x (5), prints 2. nr = 27. Prints 1.\n    *   i = 5:  Prints 1.  nr (27) >= x (5), prints 2. nr = 81. Prints 1.\n\nOutput: 1111121121\n\n**(b)**\n\n*   Input: x = 10\n*   We want the digit '2' to be printed exactly three times.  The '2' is printed only when `nr >= x`.\n*   Since x=10 we need to choose values for y, such that `nr` reaches or exceeds 10 only three times during the loop from y to 10 (inclusive).\n\nLet y = 10:\nLoop from 10 to 10: Prints 1. nr(1) is not >=10, nr=3. Prints 1 -> only one step. 2 is not printed\n\nConsider nr's growth within the loop: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ...  We need `nr` to become >= 10 three times during loop iterations. Let's work backward from when nr>=x.\n\n* If we have 3 '2's printed we have nr = 1, then 3, then 9, then 27 and then nr >= 10. The condition has to be true 3 times, starting from y to x.\n* If y = 10, only 1 time. If y = 11, 2 times. If y = 12, then we have iterations 12, 11, 10. nr goes 1->3->9->27, and 2 is printed 1 time.\n\n* Let us say that '2' should appear for iterations with i= 12, 11, 10: nr >= x. nr: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81.\nWe need nr >=10 in the last 3 rounds. So, we start with y such that nr=9 before i=12, nr = 3 before i=13. nr=1 before i=14\nThus y=14,x=10 is the first solution.\n\ny=13:\n13, 12, 11, 10: 1->3->9->27. The 2 will be printed 2 times (at 11 and 10)\ny=12:\n12, 11, 10: 1->3->9->27. The 2 will be printed 2 times (at 11 and 10).\ny=11:\n11, 10: 1->3->9. '2' printed 1 time (i=10)\n\ny=14: 14,13,12,11,10. nr = 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 27 -> 81. '2' prints at 12,11,10: exactly 3 times.\ny=15: 15,14,13,12,11,10. nr= 1->3->9->27->81->243. '2' prints 4 times.\n\nOther solution, consider starting the loop y such that the last 3 iterations print '2' and x=10\n- i=12,11,10. nr needs to be 9 when i is 12, meaning nr =3 for i=13 and 1 for i=14, so y=14.\n\nLet's try y=13. loop is 13, 12, 11, 10. nr will go from 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 27\n2 is displayed for 11 and 10.\n\nLet y = 32, x = 10\n32, 31,...10.\nnr = 1,3,9,27,81,... 2 will be displayed a lot.\n\nSo let y =14.\n\nAnother solution:\n\nIf y = 31\nWe want to reach x in exactly three steps (of multiplying *3) before nr becomes >=10\ny = x + 2, loop will be x+2, x+1, x\n\n1  3  9, if we start by 9 it won't work.\nstart from y = 14.\n\n### Answer\n(a) 1111121121\n(b) y = 14 and y = 31 (Other answers might be possible, we found 2)\n\n**(c)**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n  int x, y, nr, temp;\n\n  std::cin >> x >> y;\n\n  if (x > y) {\n    temp = x;\n    x = y;\n    y = temp;\n  }\n\n  nr = 1;\n\n  for (int i = y; i >= x; --i) {\n    std::cout << 1;\n    if (nr >= x) {\n      std::cout << 2;\n    }\n    nr *= 3;\n    std::cout << 1;\n  }\n  std::cout << std::endl;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**(d)**\n\n```pseudocode\ncitește x,y\n (numere naturale nenule)\n┌dacă x>y atunci xy\n└■\nnr1\ni <- y\n┌cât timp i>=x execută\n│ scrie 1\n│┌dacă nr≥x atunci\n││ scrie 2\n│└■\n│ nrnr*3\n│ scrie 1\n| i <- i-1\n└■\n\n```\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis problem involves generating combinations of birds using backtracking. The constraints are:\n1.  At least two birds in each group.\n2.  \"mierlă\" (blackbird) and \"privighetoare\" (nightingale) cannot be in the same group.\n3.  Groups are distinct by at least one bird.\n\nThe first four solutions are given, and we need to find the next two after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe follow the backtracking order, respecting the constraints.

Then we must skip mierla due to the constraint with privighetoare, so the first one is (ciocarlie, scatiu)\n\nNext we go to (mierla), but mierla cannot go with privighetoare, so we try to combine mierla with the next elements:\nWe have then (mierla, scatiu)\n\n### Answer\n(ciocârlie, scatiu), (mierlă, scatiu)\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a `struct` named `fractie` with members `a` (numerator) and `b` (denominator). Variables `f` and `fs` are declared as `fractie`. We need to store in `fs` the result of subtracting the fraction represented by `f` from 2020/2021, *without* using any additional variables.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe subtraction of two fractions a/b and c/d is (ad - bc) / bd. In our case, we want to calculate (2020/2021) - (f.a/f.b), which equals (2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a) / (2021 * f.b). We can directly assign the calculated numerator and denominator to `fs.a` and `fs.b`, respectively.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\nfs.a = 2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a;\nfs.b = 2021 * f.b;\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function `divPrim(n, s)` that calculates the sum of the prime divisors of `n` that appear with an odd power in the prime factorization of `n`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Iterate through potential divisors `d` starting from 2.\n2.  For each `d`, check if it's a divisor of `n`.\n3.  If `d` is a divisor, count the power of `d` in the factorization of `n`.\n4.  If the power is odd, and the divisor is prime, add the divisor to the sum `s`.\n5.  Continue until `n` becomes 1.\n6. If `n` is still greater than 1 at the end it must be prime, check its power as well.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid divPrim(long long n, long long& s) {\n  s = 0;\n  long long d = 2;\n  while (n > 1) {\n    int p = 0;\n    while (n % d == 0) {\n      p++;\n      n /= d;\n    }\n    if (p % 2 != 0) {\n      s += d;\n    }\n    if (d == 2)\n        d = 3;\n    else\n        d += 2;\n\n    if (d*d > n && n > 1) {\n        s = s + n;\n        n = 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  long long n = 360;\n  long long s;\n  divPrim(n, s);\n  std::cout << s << std::endl; // Output: 7\n\n  n = 16;\n  divPrim(n, s);\n  std::cout << s << std::endl; // Output: 0\n\n    n = 2*3*3*5*5*5;\n    divPrim(n,s);\n    std::cout << s << std::endl;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe program needs to read `n` words, then print the first `k` words ending in a vowel. If there are fewer than `k` such words, it should print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the words one by one.\n3.  For each word, check if its last character is a vowel.\n4.  If it is, print the word and decrement `k`.\n5.  If `k` becomes 0, stop.\n6.  After reading all words, if `k` is still greater than 0, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n  int n, k;\n  std::cin >> n >> k;\n  std::cin.ignore(); \n\n  int count = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n    std::string word;\n    std::getline(std::cin, word);\n\n    if (word.length() > 0) {\n      char lastChar = word[word.length() - 1];\n      if (lastChar == 'a' || lastChar == 'e' || lastChar == 'i' ||\n          lastChar == 'o' || lastChar == 'u') {\n        if (count < k) {\n          std::cout << word << std::endl;\n          count++;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (count < k) {\n    std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe program reads a number `x` and a sequence of numbers from a file. It needs to find the last two consecutive numbers in the sequence that have `x` as a suffix.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `x` from the first line of the file.\n2.  Read the numbers from the second line one by one.\n3.  Keep track of the two most recent numbers that have `x` as a suffix (say `prev` and `current`).\n4.  A number `a` has `x` as a suffix if `a % (10^digits(x)) == x`.\n5.  If a number has `x` as a suffix, update `prev` and `current`.\n6. If no two consecutive numbers has x as a suffix, display \"nu exista\"\n\n### Answer\n\n**(a) Algorithm Description (Efficiency Justification)**\n\n1.  **Read `x`:** Read the value of `x` from the first line of the file.\n2.  **Initialize:** Initialize `prev` and `current` to -1 (or any value that cannot be a valid number in the input).\n3.  **Iterate through the sequence:** Read numbers one by one from the second line of the file.\n    *   **Check for Suffix:** For each number `num`, check if it has `x` as a suffix. To efficiently check this we can use the modulo operator. Calculate 10 raised to the power of the number of digits in x (e.g., if x is 210, this value would be 1000). If 'num' mod 'power_of_10' equals x, then x is the suffix.\n    *   **Update `prev` and `current`:** If `num` has `x` as a suffix:\n        *   Set `prev` to the value of `current`.\n        *   Set `current` to `num`.\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   If both `prev` and `current` are different to -1, it means we found at least two consecutive numbers.\n    *    Output `prev` and `current` separated by a space.\n    *   Otherwise, output \"nu exista\".\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\n*   **Memory Efficiency:** We use a constant amount of extra memory (for `x`, `prev`, `current`, `num`, `power_of_10`). We do *not* store the entire sequence, making the memory usage independent of the sequence length (O(1) space complexity).\n*   **Time Efficiency:** We iterate through the sequence only once. The suffix check and other operations within the loop take constant time. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the sequence (O(N), where N is the number of elements in the file's sequence).  Calculating the power of 10 can be done outside the main loop.\n\n**(b) C++ Code**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nint main() {\n  std::ifstream inputFile(\"bac.txt\");\n  long long x, num, prev = -1, current = -1;\n\n  inputFile >> x;\n\n  long long power_of_10 = 1;\n  long long temp_x = x;\n  while (temp_x > 0) {\n    power_of_10 *= 10;\n    temp_x /= 10;\n  }\n\n  while (inputFile >> num) {\n    if (num % power_of_10 == x) {\n      prev = current;\n      current = num;\n    }\n  }\n\n  inputFile.close();\n\n  if (prev != -1 && current != -1) {\n    std::cout << prev << \" \" << current << std::endl;\n  } else {\n    std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n",

If y+1 is odd, then y must be even.\nb. `(x-y)/2==0` - This checks if (x-y) is 0 or 1 (due to integer division).\nc. `(x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0` - This checks if both sum and difference have the same parity.\nd. `x%2==y%2` - This checks if x and y have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is d. `x%2==y%2`\n\nThis expression will return 1 (true) when both x and y are even (x%2==0 and y%2==0) or when both are odd (x%2==1 and y%2==1). However, we need the expression to be true only when both are even.\n\nWait, I made an error in my analysis. Let's reconsider:\na. `x%2==0 && (y+1)%2!=0` - First part checks if x is even. Second part checks if y+1 is not even, which means y is even. So this checks if both x and y are even.\nb. `(x-y)/2==0` - This checks if (x-y) is 0 or 1, which doesn't guarantee both are even.\nc. `(x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0` - If both sum and difference have the same parity, then both numbers must have the same parity. This is true if both are even or both are odd.\nd. `x%2==y%2` - This checks if both have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\nReconsidering all options, the correct answer is a. `x%2==0 && (y+1)%2!=0`\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2021\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine which values of n and c will make the function f(n,c) return the value 2021.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function f works as follows:\n1. If n is 0, it returns 0.\n2. If the last digit of n is equal to c, it ignores this digit and continues with n/10.\n3. If the last digit of n is not equal to c, it keeps this digit and continues with n/10.\n\nThe function essentially removes all instances of digit c from the number n.\n\n### Answer\nLet's check each option:\n\na. n=2021 and c=0:\n   f(2021,0) = f(202,0) * 10 + 1 = f(20,0) * 100 + 2 * 10 + 1 = f(2,0) * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 1 = 2 * 1000 + 0 + 20 + 1 = 2021\n\nb. n=200211 and c=2:\n   f(200211,2) = f(20021,2) * 10 + 1 = f(2002,2) * 100 + 1 * 10 + 1 = f(200,2) * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 1 * 10 + 1 = f(20,2) * 10000 + 0 * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 1 * 10 + 1 = f(2,2) * 100000 + 0 * 10000 + 0 * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 1 * 10 + 1 = f(0,2) * 10 + 0 = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0 ≠ 2021\n\nc. n=312032 and c=3:\n   f(312032,3) = f(31203,3) * 10 + 2 = f(3120,3) * 100 + 0 * 10 + 2 = f(312,3) * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 2 = f(31,3) * 10000 + 2 * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 2 = f(3,3) * 100000 + 1 * 10000 + 2 * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 2 = f(0,3) * 10 + 1 * 10000 + 2 * 1000 + 2 = 0 * 10 + 10000 + 2000 + 2 = 12002 ≠ 2021\n\nd. n=720721 and c=7:\n   f(720721,7) = f(72072,7) * 10 + 1 = f(7207,7) * 100 + 2 * 10 + 1 = f(720,7) * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 1 = f(72,7) * 10000 + 0 * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 1 = f(7,7) * 100000 + 2 * 10000 + 0 * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 1 = f(0,7) * 10 + 2 * 10000 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 1 = 0 * 10 + 20000 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 1 = 20021 ≠ 2021\n\nNone of the given options seems to return exactly 2021. Let me double check option a again:\n\nFor n=2021 and c=0:\n- f(2021,0) processes the last digit (1), which is not 0, so it keeps it and processes 202\n- f(202,0) processes the last digit (2), which is not 0, so it keeps it and processes 20\n- f(20,0) processes the last digit (0), which equals c, so it drops it and processes 2\n- f(2,0) processes the last digit (2), which is not 0, so it keeps it and processes 0\n- f(0,0) returns 0\n- Building back: 0*10 + 2 = 2, then 2*10 + 0 (dropped), then 2*10 + 2 = 22, then 22*10 + 1 = 221\n\nSo f(2021,0) = 221, not 2021. Let me recalculate more carefully:\n\nWait, I made a mistake. When the digit equals c, it doesn't include that digit in the final number. I'll redo:\n\na. n=2021, c=0:\n   - 1 != 0, so keep 1\n   - 2 != 0, so keep 2\n   - 0 == 0, so drop it\n   - 2 != 0, so keep 2\n   Result: 221 (which is not 2021)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not a. Let me carefully recheck the other options.\n\nThe answer is none of the given options, as none of them produce the exact value 2021.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify the expression that accesses an element on the secondary diagonal of a 100x100 matrix.\n\n### Solution Approach\nIn a square matrix of size n×n (with indices starting from 0):\n- The main diagonal consists of elements where row index equals column index: matrix[i][i]\n- The secondary diagonal consists of elements where the sum of row and column indices equals n-1: matrix[i][n-1-i]\n\nIn our case, n = 100, so the secondary diagonal elements have the property: i + j = 99\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is d. `m[42][57]`\n\nLet's check: 42 + 57 = 99, so this element is indeed on the secondary diagonal.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify an elementary cycle in a given undirected graph with 6 nodes and specific edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\nAn elementary cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, without repeating any other vertices. Let's identify the edges of the graph:\n[1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5], [5,6]\n\n### Answer\nLet's check each option:\na. 1,2,3 - This is not a cycle as it doesn't return to the starting node\nb. 1,2,3,1 - This forms a cycle: 1→2→3→1 (using edges [1,2], [2,3], and [1,3])\nc. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1 - This repeats vertex 3, so it's not an elementary cycle\nd. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1 - There's no edge connecting nodes 6 and 1, so this is not a valid path\n\nThe correct answer is b. 1,2,3,1\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe're analyzing a rooted tree where all nodes on the same level have the same number of children, and no two different levels have the same number of nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children per node at level i as c_i.\nThe number of nodes at each level would be:\n- Level 0: 1 node (root)\n- Level 1: c_0 nodes\n- Level 2: c_0 × c_1 nodes\n- Level 3: c_0 × c_1 × c_2 nodes\n\nWe need to find the minimum possible number of nodes at level 3.\n\n### Answer\nFor this minimum number, we need the smallest possible values for c_0, c_1, and c_2, but also ensuring that no two levels have the same count.\n\nIf we use c_0 = 2, c_1 = 2, c_2 = 2, then:\n- Level 0: 1 node\n- Level 1: 2 nodes\n- Level 2: 4 nodes\n- Level 3: 8 nodes\n\nBut let's check if we can get a smaller value, maybe with c_0 = 1?\nIf c_0 = 1, then level 1 has only 1 node, which is the same as level 0, violating our constraint.\n\nWhat about c_0 = 3, c_1 = 1, c_2 = 3?\n- Level 0: 1 node\n- Level 1: 3 nodes\n- Level 2: 3 nodes (violates constraint, same as level 1)\n\nWhat about c_0 = 3, c_1 = 1, c_2 = 1?\n- Level 0: 1 node\n- Level 1: 3 nodes\n- Level 2: 3 nodes (violates constraint, same as level 1)\n\nLet's try c_0 = 2, c_1 = 2, c_2 = 1:\n- Level 0: 1 node\n- Level 1: 2 nodes\n- Level 2: 4 nodes\n- Level 3: 4 nodes (violates constraint, same as level 2)\n\nLet's try c_0 = 3, c_1 = 1, c_2 = 2:\n- Level 0: 1 node\n- Level 1: 3 nodes\n- Level 2: 3 nodes (violates constraint, same as level 1)\n\nIt seems like our initial assessment with c_0 = 2, c_1 = 2, c_2 = 2 is the minimal solution for level 3.\n\nHowever, let's check c_0 = 3, c_1 = 1, c_2 = 3 again:\n- Level 0: 1 node\n- Level 1: 3 nodes\n- Level 2: 3×1 = 3 nodes\n- Level 3: 3×1×3 = 9 nodes\n\nSo the minimum number of nodes at level 3 is 8 or possibly 9.\n\nAnother try: c_0 = 2, c_1 = 1, c_2 = 4\n- Level 0: 1 node\n- Level 1: 2 nodes\n- Level 2: 2×1 = 2 nodes\n- Level 3: 2×1×4 = 8 nodes\n\nThe correct answer is c. 8 (as it's the smallest value from the options that satisfies all constraints).\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to trace the execution of the given algorithm, implement it in C++, and modify it to use a different loop structure.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe algorithm performs the following steps:\n1. Reads two natural numbers x and y\n2. Ensures that x ≤ y by swapping if necessary\n3. Initializes nr to 1\n4. Loops from y down to x (decreasing by 1)\n5. For each value i in the loop:\n   - Prints \"1\"\n   - If nr ≥ x, prints \"2\"\n   - Multiplies nr by 3\n   - Prints \"1\"\n\n#### a. Tracing for x=8, y=5\nFirst, since x(8) > y(5), values are swapped, so x=5 and y=8.\nnr=1\nLoop from i=8 down to i=5:\n  i=8: print 1, nr=1 < x=5 (no 2), nr=3, print 1\n  i=7: print 1, nr=3 < x=5 (no 2), nr=9, print 1\n  i=6: print 1, nr=9 ≥ x=5 (print 2), nr=27, print 1\n  i=5: print 1, nr=27 ≥ x=5 (print 2), nr=81, print 1\nOutput: 1121121211\n\n#### b. Finding y values for x=10 that produce exactly three 2s\nIf x=10, we need to find values of y where the condition nr≥x becomes true exactly 3 times during the loop.\n\n### Answer\n#### a. The output for x=8, y=5 is: 1121121211\n\n#### b. For x=10, the condition nr≥x will be true when nr reaches or exceeds 10.\nStarting with nr=1:\n- After 1st iteration: nr=3\n- After 2nd iteration: nr=9\n- After 3rd iteration: nr=27 (now nr≥10)\n- After 4th iteration: nr=81 (nr≥10)\n- After 5th iteration: nr=243 (nr≥10)\n\nFor exactly 3 prints of \"2\", we need the loop to run exactly 5 iterations, meaning y-x+1=5, so y=x+4=14.\nAnother option is to start with a higher value of x and y, but still have 5 loop iterations, like y=24 and x=20.\n\nSo two possible answers are: y=14 and y=24.\n\n#### c. C++ program implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y, nr = 1;\n    \n    // Read input\n    cin >> x >> y;\n    \n    // Ensure x ≤ y\n    if (x > y) {\n        int temp = x;\n        x = y;\n        y = temp;\n    }\n    \n    // Loop from y down to x\n    for (int i = y; i >= x; i--) {\n        cout << \"1\";\n        if (nr >= x) {\n            cout << \"2\";\n        }\n        nr = nr * 3;\n        cout << \"1\";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n#### d. Algorithm with while loop instead of for loop:\n\n```\ncitește x,y\n(numere naturale nenule)\ndacă x>y atunci xy\nnr1\ni←y\ncât timp i>=x execută\n    scrie 1\n    dacă nr≥x atunci\n        scrie 2\n    nr←nr*3\n    scrie 1\n    i←i-1\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify the next two solutions generated using backtracking after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu).\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe backtracking algorithm generates all combinations of at least 2 birds from the set {cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, privighetoare, scatiu}, with the constraint that mierlă and privighetoare can't be in the same group.\n\nLooking at the first 4 solutions:\n1. (cinteză, ciocârlie)\n2. (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă)\n3. (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu)\n4. (cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare)\n\nAnd we need to find what comes after: (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu)\n\nThe generation seems to follow a lexicographic order based on subset size and then elements:\n- First all subsets of size 2\n- Then all subsets of size 3\n- Then all subsets of size 4\n- Then all subsets of size 5\n\n### Answer\nAfter analyzing the generation pattern, the next two solutions after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu) would be:\n1. (ciocârlie, scatiu)\n2.

Factorize n into its prime factors\n2. For each prime factor, check if its power/exponent is odd\n3. If it's odd, add it to the sum\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nvoid divPrim(long long n, int& s) {\n    s = 0;\n    // Try each possible prime divisor from 2 to sqrt(n)\n    for (long long d = 2; d * d <= n; d++) {\n        int count = 0;\n        // Count how many times d divides n\n        while (n % d == 0) {\n            count++;\n            n /= d;\n        }\n        // If d is a prime divisor and appears an odd number of times\n        if (count % 2 == 1) {\n            s += d;\n        }\n    }\n    // If n is still > 1, it must be a prime number itself\n    if (n > 1) {\n        s += n; // n appears once (odd)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a program that reads n words and outputs the first k words that end with a vowel, or \"nu exista\" if there aren't k such words.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read n and k\n2. Read n words\n3. Count how many words end with a vowel and output the first k of them\n4. If fewer than k words end with a vowel, output \"nu exista\"\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool endsWithVowel(string word) {\n    char lastChar = word[word.length() - 1];\n    return (lastChar == 'a' || lastChar == 'e' || lastChar == 'i' || \n            lastChar == 'o' || lastChar == 'u');\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    cin >> n >> k;\n    \n    int count = 0; // Count words that end with vowel\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        string word;\n        cin >> word;\n        \n        if (endsWithVowel(word)) {\n            cout << word << endl;\n            count++;\n            \n            // Stop when we've found k words\n            if (count == k) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // If we didn't find k words that end with vowel\n    if (count < k) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the last two consecutive numbers in a file that have the number x as their suffix.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read x from the first line\n2. Read each number from the second line one by one\n3. Check if each number has x as its suffix\n4. Keep track of the last two consecutive numbers that satisfy this condition\n\nA number has x as its suffix if it can be divided by 10^(number of digits in x) and the remainder equals x.\n\n### Answer\n#### a. Algorithm description\n1. Read x from the file\n2. Calculate the number of digits in x\n3. Initialize variables to keep track of the last two numbers with x as suffix\n4. Read each number from the second line and check if it has x as suffix\n5. If it does and the previous number also had x as suffix, update the result\n6. After processing all numbers, output the result or \"nu exista\" if no such pair was found\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n- It processes each number only once (O(n) time complexity)\n- It only keeps track of the last valid number (O(1) space complexity)\n- It avoids unnecessary comparisons by using modular arithmetic to check suffixes\n\n#### b. C++ Implementation\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x;\n    fin >> x;\n    \n    // Calculate power of 10 to use for suffix check\n    int power = 1;\n    int tempX = x;\n    while (tempX > 0) {\n        power *= 10;\n        tempX /= 10;\n    }\n    \n    long long prev = -1; // Previous number with x as suffix\n    long long current = -1; // Current number with x as suffix\n    long long num;\n    \n    // Read each number and check for suffix\n    while (fin >> num) {\n        if (num % power == x) {\n            prev = current;\n            current = num;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Check if we found at least two numbers\n    if (prev != -1 && current != -1) {\n        cout << prev << \" \" << current;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```"
