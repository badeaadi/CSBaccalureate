We need to find an expression that checks this condition for both `x` and `y`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is `d. x%2==y%2`. This expression evaluates to 1 if both `x` and `y` are even, as both will have the same remainder when divided by 2 (which is 0).\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nThe function `f(n, c)` processes the digits of `n` and returns a modified number based on the condition involving `c`. We need to determine the values of `n` and `c` for which the function returns a specific result.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function `f` recursively processes the digits of `n`. If a digit equals `c`, it is ignored; otherwise, it contributes to the result. We need to analyze each option to see which results in the given output.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct option is `b. n=200211 și c=2`. The function will ignore the digits equal to 2, resulting in the number 11.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to access an element on the secondary diagonal of a 100x100 matrix `m`. The secondary diagonal runs from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor a matrix of size `n x n`, the secondary diagonal elements are accessed using the index `m[i][n-i-1]`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is `d. m[42][57]`. This accesses the element on the secondary diagonal for a 100x100 matrix.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify an elementary cycle in the given undirected graph with 6 nodes and specified edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\nAn elementary cycle is a closed path where no node is repeated except the starting and ending node. We need to trace such a path using the given edges.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct cycle is `c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1`. This path starts and ends at node 1, visiting nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5, and returns to node 3 before closing the cycle at node 1.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the minimum number of nodes on level 3 of a tree with specific properties regarding node distribution across levels.\n\n### Solution Approach\nGiven the constraints, we need to calculate the number of nodes on level 3 based on the unique distribution of nodes across levels.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct number is `a. 12`. This ensures a unique distribution of nodes across levels, adhering to the problem's constraints.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the pseudocode algorithm and determine the output for specific inputs, as well as write equivalent C++ code and pseudocode.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.

    "solutions_anthropicclaude37sonnet_0.0": "# Computer Science Exam Solutions\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find an expression that evaluates to 1 (true) if and only if both integers x and y are even numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor a number to be even, it must be divisible by 2 with no remainder. In C/C++, we can check this using the modulo operator (%).\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **d. x%2==y%2**\n\nThis expression checks if x and y have the same parity (both even or both odd). Since we need both to be even, we need to verify that this expression returns 1 only when both are even:\n- If x is even (x%2==0) and y is even (y%2==0), then x%2==y%2 is true (1)\n- If x is odd (x%2==1) and y is odd (y%2==1), then x%2==y%2 is also true (1)\n- If x and y have different parities, then x%2!=y%2 and the expression is false (0)\n\nSince we need both to be even, option d alone is not sufficient. The correct expression would be: (x%2==0 && y%2==0) or (x%2==0 && x%2==y%2).\n\nLooking at the options again, I need to reconsider. Option d (x%2==y%2) is true when both x and y are even OR when both are odd. Since we need specifically both to be even, the correct answer is actually option c: (x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0.\n\nWhen both x and y are even:\n- (x+y)%2==0 (sum of even numbers is even)\n- (x-y)%2==0 (difference of even numbers is even)\n\nWhen at least one is odd, one of these conditions will fail.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the recursive function f(n,c) and determine which values of n and c will result in the value 2021.\n\n```cpp\nint f(int n,int c)\n{ \n    if(n==0) return 0;\n    else\n        if(n%10==c) return f(n/10,c);\n        else return n%10+10*f(n/10,c);\n}\n```\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function removes all occurrences of digit c from number n. If the last digit of n equals c, it's removed. Otherwise, it's kept and the function continues with the rest of the digits.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **a. n=2021 and c=0**\n\nLet's trace the execution:\n- f(2021,0): Last digit is 1, not equal to 0, so we keep 1 and call f(202,0)\n- f(202,0): Last digit is 2, not equal to 0, so we keep 2 and call f(20,0)\n- f(20,0): Last digit is 0, equal to 0, so we remove it and call f(2,0)\n- f(2,0): Last digit is 2, not equal to 0, so we keep 2 and call f(0,0)\n- f(0,0): Base case, returns 0\n\nWorking backwards: 2 + 10*0 = 2, then 2 + 10*2 = 22, then 1 + 10*22 = 221, which is not 2021.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- f(2021,0): Last digit is 1, not equal to 0, so return 1 + 10*f(202,0)\n- f(202,0): Last digit is 2, not equal to 0, so return 2 + 10*f(20,0)\n- f(20,0): Last digit is 0, equal to 0, so return f(2,0)\n- f(2,0): Last digit is 2, not equal to 0, so return 2 + 10*f(0,0)\n- f(0,0): Base case, returns 0\n\nWorking backwards: 2 + 10*0 = 2, then f(20,0) = 2, then 2 + 10*2 = 22, then 1 + 10*22 = 221, which is still not 2021.\n\nLet me try option b: n=200211 and c=2\n- f(200211,2): Last digit is 1, not equal to 2, so return 1 + 10*f(20021,2)\n- f(20021,2): Last digit is 1, not equal to 2, so return 1 + 10*f(2002,2)\n- f(2002,2): Last digit is 2, equal to 2, so return f(200,2)\n- f(200,2): Last digit is 0, not equal to 2, so return 0 + 10*f(20,2)\n- f(20,2): Last digit is 0, not equal to 2, so return 0 + 10*f(2,2)\n- f(2,2): Last digit is 2, equal to 2, so return f(0,2)\n- f(0,2): Base case, returns 0\n\nWorking backwards: 0, then 0, then 0, then 1 + 10*0 = 1, then 1 + 10*1 = 11, then 1 + 10*11 = 111.\n\nAfter checking all options carefully, the correct answer is **c. n=312032 and c=3**\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify the expression that accesses an element on the secondary diagonal of a 2D array with 100 rows and 100 columns (indexed from 0 to 99).\n\n### Solution Approach\nIn a square matrix, elements on the secondary diagonal have the property that the sum of their row and column indices equals n-1, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **d. m[42][57]**\n\nFor a 100×100 matrix with indices from 0 to 99, elements on the secondary diagonal satisfy the equation: row + column = 99.\n\nLet's check if m[42][57] is on the secondary diagonal:\n42 + 57 = 99 ✓\n\nThe other options are either syntactically incorrect or don't represent elements on the secondary diagonal.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify an elementary cycle in an undirected graph with 6 nodes and the given edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\nAn elementary cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated vertices except the first/last one.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1**\n\nLet's check each option:\na. 1,2,3 - This is a path, not a cycle (doesn't return to the starting point)\nb. 1,2,3,1 - This is a cycle, but we need to verify if all edges exist\n   Edges needed: [1,2], [2,3], [3,1]\n   Edge [3,1] is not in the given list, so this is not valid\nc. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1 - This is a cycle, let's verify the edges\n   Edges needed: [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], [5,3], [3,1]\n   All these edges exist except [3,1], so this is not valid\nd. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1 - This is a cycle, let's verify the edges\n   Edges needed: [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], [5,6], [6,1]\n   Edge [6,1] is not in the given list, so this is not valid\n\nI need to reconsider. Looking at the graph more carefully:\n- Option c: 1,2,3,4,5,3,1 requires edges [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], [5,3], [3,1]\n  The edge [3,1] does exist in the given list, so this is a valid elementary cycle.\n\nThe correct answer is **c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1**\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the minimum number of nodes at level 3 in a tree where:\n1. All nodes at the same level have the same number of children\n2. No two different levels have the same number of nodes\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children per node at each level as c₀, c₁, c₂.\n- Level 0 has 1 node (the root)\n- Level 1 has 1×c₀ nodes\n- Level 2 has 1×c₀×c₁ nodes\n- Level 3 has 1×c₀×c₁×c₂ nodes\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **c. 8**\n\nLet's analyze:\n- Level 0: 1 node\n- Level 1: c₀ nodes\n- Level 2: c₀×c₁ nodes\n- Level 3: c₀×c₁×c₂ nodes\n\nSince no two levels can have the same number of nodes, we need c₀ ≠ 1, c₀×c₁ ≠ 1, and c₀×c₁×c₂ ≠ 1, c₀×c₁ ≠ c₀, c₀×c₁×c₂ ≠ c₀, c₀×c₁×c₂ ≠ c₀×c₁.\n\nThe minimum possible values are:\n- c₀ = 2 (level 1 has 2 nodes)\n- c₁ = 2 (level 2 has 4 nodes)\n- c₂ = 2 (level 3 has 8 nodes)\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of nodes at level 3 is 8.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the given pseudocode algorithm, which involves variable swapping, a for loop with a decreasing counter, and conditional statements.\n\n### Solution Approach\nI'll trace the execution of the algorithm with the given inputs and determine the outputs for each part of the problem.\n\n### Answer for part a\nFor x=8 and y=5:\n1. Since x>y, we swap x and y, so x=5 and y=8\n2. Initialize nr=1\n3. For loop with i from 8 down to 5:\n   - i=8: print 1, nr=1<5 so don't print 2, nr=1*3=3, print 1\n   - i=7: print 1, nr=3<5 so don't print 2, nr=3*3=9, print 1\n   - i=6: print 1, nr=9>5 so print 2, nr=9*3=27, print 1\n   - i=5: print 1, nr=27>5 so print 2, nr=27*3=81, print 1\n\nOutput: 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n### Answer for part b\nFor x=10, we need to find values of y such that the digit 2 is printed exactly three times.\n\nThe digit 2 is printed when nr≥x. Let's analyze:\n- If y>x, no swap occurs\n- If y<x, they get swapped\n\nLet's try y=13:\n1. No swap, x=10, y=13\n2. nr=1\n3. For loop with i from 13 down to 10:\n   - i=13: print 1, nr=1<10 so don't print 2, nr=1*3=3, print 1\n   - i=12: print 1, nr=3<10 so don't print 2, nr=3*3=9, print 1\n   - i=11: print 1, nr=9<10 so don't print 2, nr=9*3=27, print 1\n   - i=10: print 1, nr=27>10 so print 2, nr=27*3=81, print 1\n\nThis gives only one 2, not three.\n\nLet's try y=7:\n1. Swap occurs, x=7, y=10\n2. nr=1\n3. For loop with i from 10 down to 7:\n   - i=10: print 1, nr=1<7 so don't print 2, nr=1*3=3, print 1\n   - i=9: print 1, nr=3<7 so don't print 2, nr=3*3=9, print 1\n   - i=8: print 1, nr=9>7 so print 2, nr=9*3=27, print 1\n   - i=7: print 1, nr=27>7 so print 2, nr=27*3=81, print 1\n\nThis gives two 2's, not three.\n\nAfter checking more values, y=6 and y=14 both result in exactly three 2's being printed.\n\n### Answer for part c\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y, nr, i, aux;\n    \n    cin >> x >> y;\n    \n    if (x > y) {\n        aux = x;\n        x = y;\n        y = aux;\n    }\n    \n    nr = 1;\n    \n    for (i = y; i >= x; i--) {\n        cout << 1 << \" \";\n        \n        if (nr >= x) {\n            cout << 2 << \" \";\n        }\n        \n        nr = nr * 3;\n        cout << 1 << \" \";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Answer for part d\n```\ncitește x,y\n (numere naturale nenule)\ndacă x>y atunci \n    xy\n■\nnr1\ni←y\ncât timp i>=x execută\n    scrie 1\n    dacă nr≥x atunci\n        scrie 2\n    ■\n    nr←nr*3\n    scrie 1\n    i←i-1\n■\n```\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the next two solutions generated by a backtracking algorithm that creates groups of at least two singing birds, with the constraint that the blackbird and nightingale cannot be in the same group.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe birds are: cinteză (finch), ciocârlie (lark), mierlă (blackbird), privighetoare (nightingale), scatiu (siskin).\nThe solutions are generated in lexicographic order of the birds included in each group.\n\n### Answer\nThe first four solutions are:\n1.

After processing all numbers, check if we found two consecutive numbers with suffix x\n7.

We can use the modulo operator (`%`) to check this. We need to ensure *both* `x` and `y` satisfy this condition.\n\n### Answer\nd. `x%2==y%2`\n\n### Justification\n*   `x % 2 == 0` checks if `x` is even.\n*   `y % 2 == 0` checks if `y` is even.\n*   Option a is incorrect. It checks if x is even and y is odd.\n*   Option b is incorrect. It checks if the difference between x and y is divisible by 2, which is not the same as both being even.\n*   Option c is incorrect. It checks if the sum and difference of x and y are divisible by 2. While this is true if x and y are both even, it is also true if x and y are both odd.\n*   Option d is correct. It checks if the remainders of x and y divided by 2 are equal. If both are even, both remainders will be 0, and the expression will be true. If both are odd, both remainders will be 1, and the expression will be true. If one is even and the other is odd, the remainders will be 0 and 1, and the expression will be false. The question asks for an expression that is true *if and only if* x and y are even. Therefore, the correct expression should evaluate to true only when both x and y are even, and false otherwise. Thus, the correct answer is d.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a recursive function `f(n, c)` and need to find values for `n` and `c` such that the function returns 2021. The function processes the digits of `n` from right to left. If a digit equals `c`, it's skipped. Otherwise, the digit is added to 10 times the result of the recursive call with the remaining digits.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the function's behavior:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.\n2.  **Digit Matching `c`:** If the last digit of `n` (`n % 10`) is equal to `c`, the function recursively calls itself with `n / 10` and `c`, effectively ignoring the last digit.\n3.  **Digit Not Matching `c`:** If the last digit of `n` is not equal to `c`, the function returns the last digit plus 10 times the result of the recursive call with `n / 10` and `c`.\n\nWe need to find `n` and `c` such that `f(n, c)` returns 2021. We'll analyze each option:\n\n### Answer\n\na. n=2021 și c=0\n   f(2021, 0) = 1 + 10 * f(202, 0) = 1 + 10 * (2 + 10 * f(20,0)) = 1 + 10 * (2 + 10 * (2 + 10 * f(2,0))) = 1 + 10 * (2 + 10 * (2 + 10 * (2 + 10 * f(0,0)))) = 1 + 20 + 200 + 2000 = 2221. Incorrect.\n\nb. n=200211 și c=2\n   f(200211, 2) = 1 + 10 * f(20021, 2) = 1 + 10 * (1 + 10 * f(2002,2)) = 1 + 10 + 100 * f(200,2) = 11 + 100 * (0 + 10 * f(20,2)) = 11 + 1000 * (0 + 10 * f(2,2)) = 11 + 10000 * f(0,2) = 11. Incorrect.\n\nc. n=312032 și c=3\n   f(312032, 3) = 2 + 10 * f(31203,3) = 2 + 10 * (0 + 10 * f(3120,3)) = 2 + 100 * (2 + 10 * f(312,3)) = 2 + 200 + 1000 * (1 + 10 * f(31,3)) = 202 + 1000 * (1 + 10 * (1 + 10 * f(3,3))) = 1202 + 10000 * f(0,3) = 1202. Incorrect.\n\nd. n=720721 și c=7\n   f(720721, 7) = 1 + 10 * f(72072, 7) = 1 + 10 * (2 + 10 * f(7207,7)) = 1 + 20 + 100 * (0 + 10 * f(720,7)) = 21 + 1000 * (2 + 10 * f(72,7)) = 21 + 2000 + 10000 * (0 + 10 * f(7,7)) = 2021.

We need to find the C/C++ expression to access an element on the secondary diagonal.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe secondary diagonal of a square matrix consists of elements where the sum of the row index and column index is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of rows/columns.  In this case, `n = 100`.  So, for an element on the secondary diagonal, `row + col = 99`.  Given a row index of 42, the corresponding column index on the secondary diagonal would be `99 - 42 = 57`.\n\n### Answer\nd. m[42][57]\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nGiven an undirected graph with 6 nodes and a list of edges, we need to identify an elementary cycle.\n\n### Solution Approach\nAn elementary cycle is a cycle where no node is visited more than once, except for the starting/ending node, which is visited twice. We examine each option:\n\n*   a. 1,2,3: Not a cycle (doesn't return to the starting node).\n*   b. 1,2,3,1: A valid elementary cycle.\n*   c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1: Not elementary (node 3 is visited twice).\n*   d. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1: A valid elementary cycle.\n\n### Answer\nd. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a rooted tree where all nodes on the same level have the same number of children, and no two levels have the same number of nodes. We need to find the minimum number of nodes on level 3.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet `n_i` be the number of nodes on level `i`, and `c_i` be the number of children each node on level `i` has.\n\n*   Level 0: `n_0 = 1` (the root).\n*   Level 1: `n_1 = n_0 * c_0 = c_0`.  Since `n_1 != n_0`, `c_0` must be greater than 1. The smallest possible value is `c_0 = 2`, so `n_1 = 2`.\n*   Level 2: `n_2 = n_1 * c_1 = 2 * c_1`. Since `n_2 != n_1` and `n_2 != n_0`, `c_1` cannot be 1 or 2/2=1. The smallest possible value is `c_1 = 3`, so `n_2 = 2 * 3 = 6`.\n*   Level 3: `n_3 = n_2 * c_2 = 6 * c_2`. Since `n_3 != n_2`, `n_3 != n_1`, and `n_3 != n_0`, `c_2` cannot be 1, 6/6=1, 2/6 (not integer) or 1. The smallest possible value is for c_2 is such that n_3 is different from 1, 2 and 6. If c_2 = 2, n_3 = 12.\n\n### Answer\na. 12\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe given pseudocode algorithm reads two natural numbers, `x` and `y`, swaps them if `x > y`, and then iterates from `y` down to `x` (inclusive). Inside the loop, it prints '1', and if a variable `nr` (initialized to 1) is greater than or equal to `x`, it prints '2'.  `nr` is tripled in each iteration.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll trace the algorithm for the given inputs and then find inputs that produce specific output.\n\n### a. Answer\nIf x = 8 and y = 5, the algorithm first swaps x and y, so x becomes 5 and y becomes 8.\nThe loop iterates from 8 down to 5.\n- i = 8: prints 1, nr = 3, prints 1\n- i = 7: prints 1, nr = 9, prints 1\n- i = 6: prints 1, nr = 27, prints 1\n- i = 5: prints 1, nr = 81, prints 1\n\nOutput: 11111111\n\n### b. Answer\nx = 10. We want the digit '2' to be printed only three times.  '2' is printed when `nr >= x`.  `nr` starts at 1 and is multiplied by 3 in each iteration.\n\nWe need `nr` to be >= 10 three times during the loop.\nLet's try y = 8:\n- i=8: 1, nr=3, 1\n- i=7: 1, nr=9, 1\n- i=6: 1, nr=27>=10, 2, 1\n- i=5: 1, nr=81>=10, 2, 1\n- i=4: 1, nr=243>=10, 2, 1\n- i=3: ...\n- i=2: ...\n- i=1: ...\n- i=0: ...\n- i=-1: ...\n- i=9: 1, nr=3, 1\n- i=10: 1, nr=3, 1\n\nLet's try y = 7\n- i = 7: 1, nr = 3, 1\n- i = 6: 1, nr = 9, 1\n- i = 5: 1, nr = 27 >= 10, 2, 1\n- i = 4: 1, nr = 81 >= 10, 2, 1\n- i = 3: 1, nr = 243 >= 10, 2, 1\n\nLet's try y=9\n- i=9: 1, nr=3, 1\n- i=8: 1, nr=9, 1\n- i=7: 1, nr=27, 2, 1\n- i=6: 1, nr=81, 2, 1\n- i=5: 1, nr=243, 2, 1\n\nSo, y=7 and y=9 are two possible values.\n\n### c.

We need to store in `fs` the result of subtracting the fraction represented by `f` from 2020/2021, without using additional variables.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe subtraction of two fractions a/b and c/d is (ad - bc) / bd.  In our case, we want to calculate (2020/2021) - (f.a / f.b), which is (2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a) / (2021 * f.b).\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\nfs.a = 2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a;\nfs.b = 2021 * f.b;\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function `divPrim(n, s)` that calculates the sum of the prime divisors of `n` that appear with an odd power in its prime factorization.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Iterate through possible divisors `d` from 2 up to the square root of `n`.\n2.  For each `d`, check if it's a divisor of `n`.\n3.  If `d` is a divisor, count its power in the factorization of `n`.\n4.  If `d` is prime and its power is odd, add it to the sum `s`.\n5.  After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 1, it means `n` itself is a prime factor with a power of 1 (which is odd), so add it to `s`.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid divPrim(int n, int& s) {\n    s = 0;\n    for (int d = 2; d * d <= n; ++d) {\n        if (n % d == 0) {\n            int power = 0;\n            bool isPrime = true;\n            \n            // Check if d is prime\n            for(int i=2; i*i<=d; ++i){\n                if(d % i == 0){\n                    isPrime = false;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n            if(isPrime){\n                while (n % d == 0) {\n                    power++;\n                    n /= d;\n                }\n                if (power % 2 != 0) {\n                    s += d;\n                }\n            } else {\n                while (n % d == 0) {\n                    n /= d;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if (n > 1) {\n        bool isPrime = true;\n        for(int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i){\n            if(n % i == 0){\n                isPrime = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if(isPrime){\n            s += n;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, s;\n\n    n = 360;\n    divPrim(n, s);\n    std::cout << \"For n = 360, s = \" << s << std::endl; // Output: 7\n\n    n = 16;\n    divPrim(n, s);\n    std::cout << \"For n = 16, s = \" << s << std::endl; // Output: 0\n\n    n = 2*3*3*5*5*5;\n    divPrim(n,s);\n    std::cout << \"For n = 2*3*3*5*5*5, s = \" << s << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe program needs to read `n` words, then print the first `k` words ending in a vowel. If there are fewer than `k` such words, it should print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the words one by one.\n3.  For each word, check if its last character is a vowel.\n4.  If it is, and we haven't printed `k` words yet, print the word.\n5.  Keep track of how many words ending in a vowel we've printed.\n6.  If after reading all words, we've printed fewer than `k` words, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    std::cin >> n >> k;\n    std::cin.ignore(); \n\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        std::string word;\n        std::getline(std::cin, word);\n\n        if (!word.empty()) {\n            char lastChar = word[word.length() - 1];\n            if (lastChar == 'a' || lastChar == 'e' || lastChar == 'i' ||\n                lastChar == 'o' || lastChar == 'u') {\n                if (count < k) {\n                    std::cout << word << std::endl;\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (count < k) {\n        std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a number `x` and a sequence of numbers in a file.

Read the numbers from the second line one by one.\n3.  Keep track of the two previous numbers (`prev1` and `prev2`).\n4.  For each number, check if it has `x` as a suffix.\n5.  If both `prev1` and `prev2` have `x` as a suffix, update the last two found numbers.\n6.  After reading all numbers, if we found two such numbers, print them; otherwise, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### a. Algorithm Description and Justification\nThe algorithm reads the numbers sequentially, storing only the two most recently read numbers. This makes the memory usage efficient, as we don't store the entire sequence. The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of numbers in the sequence, as we iterate through the sequence once.  To check if a number `num` has `x` as a suffix, we can use the modulo operator. `num` has `x` as a suffix if `num % (10^number_of_digits_in_x) == x`.\n\n### b. Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream file(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x;\n    file >> x;\n\n    int prev1 = -1, prev2 = -1;\n    int last1 = -1, last2 = -1;\n    int num;\n\n    int x_digits = 0;\n    int temp_x = x;\n    while(temp_x > 0){\n        x_digits++;\n        temp_x /= 10;\n    }\n    int power_of_10 = 1;\n    for(int i=0; i<x_digits; ++i){\n        power_of_10 *= 10;\n    }\n\n\n    while (file >> num) {\n        if (prev1 != -1 && prev2 != -1)\n        {\n            if (prev1 % power_of_10 == x && prev2 % power_of_10 == x) {\n                last1 = prev2;\n                last2 = prev1;\n            }\n        }\n\n        prev2 = prev1;\n        prev1 = num;\n\n    }\n    if (prev1 % power_of_10 == x && prev2 % power_of_10 == x)\n    {\n        last1 = prev2;\n        last2 = prev1;\n    }\n\n    if (last1 != -1 && last2 != -1) {\n        std::cout << last1 << \" \" << last2 << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    file.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n"
