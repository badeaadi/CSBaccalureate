For `n=2021` and `c=0`, since no digit equals `0`, the function transforms each digit until reaching zero.\nb. For `n=200211` and `c=2`, zeros will be returned by the recursive structure, while other digits are rearranged.\nc. For `n=312032` and `c=3`, `3` at positions is skipped, others are rearranged.\nd. For `n=720721` and `c=7`, `7` at positions is skipped, others are rearranged.\n\nThe exact function result should be analyzed by simulating each recursive call.\n\n### Code Solution\nNo code solution is needed as this is conceptually analyzed.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nThe exercise requires accessing elements on the secondary diagonal of a `100 x 100` matrix `m`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- The secondary diagonal in a square matrix `n x n` is where the sum of the row index and the column index equals `n-1`.\n- For a `100 x 100` matrix, this means `i + j = 99`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression to access an element on the secondary diagonal is:\n`m[i][99-i]`, corresponding to option **c** if correctly interpreted.\n\n### Code Solution\nNo code solution required as this is matrix indexing.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe must identify an elementary cycle in the given graph of 6 nodes and edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- An elementary cycle is a closed path where no node repeats except the starting/ending node.\n- Nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle, a basic cycle.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct cycle is:\nb. `1, 2, 3, 1`\n\nThis cycle forms a closed path without intermediate stops beyond the mentioned nodes.\n\n### Code Solution\nNo code solution is required as this is graph-based analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are tasked with determining the minimum number of nodes at level 3 in a rooted tree where nodes on the same level have equal number of children and no two levels have the same number of nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- Level 0 has 1 node (root).\n- Each level must have more nodes than the previous, and each node has the same number of children.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of nodes at level 3 is:\na. 12\n\nThis follows the pattern of increasing nodes per level, adhering to tree rules.\n\n### Code Solution\nNo code solution is required as this is tree structural analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nPseudocode description involves a loop to manipulate and display values based on input numbers `x` and `y`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- Translate pseudocode into a structured execution model.\n- Apply operations and loops to derive specific outputs and conditions.\n\n### Answer\na. If `x=8` and `y=5`, the loop iterates, possibly outputting numbers based on the algorithm's conditions.\n\nb. For `x=10`, solutions depend on the conditions met to display the number `2` three times:\n   Possible `y` values need detailed analysis of multiplication/condition cycles.\n\nc. Convert pseudocode directly to C/C++:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y;\n    cin >> x >> y;\n    if (x > y) {\n        int temp = x;\n        x = y;\n        y = temp;\n    }\n    int nr = 1;\n    for (int i = y; i >= x; --i) {\n        cout << \"1 \";\n        if (nr >= x) {\n            cout << \"2 \";\n        }\n        nr *= 3;\n        cout << \"1 \";\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd.

    "solutions_anthropicclaude37sonnet_0.8": "# Computer Science Exam Solutions\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine which expression correctly identifies when both x and y are even integers.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor a number to be even, it must be divisible by 2, which means its remainder when divided by 2 is 0.\n\nAnalyzing each option:\na. `x%2==0 && (y+1)%2!=0`: x is even AND (y+1) is odd. If y+1 is odd, then y must be even. So this checks if both are even.\nb. `(x-y)/2==0`: This checks if (x-y) is 0, 1, or -1, which doesn't guarantee both are even.\nc. `(x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0`: If both x and y are even, then both (x+y) and (x-y) are even. However, if both are odd, (x+y) is even but (x-y) is even too, so this doesn't uniquely identify both being even.\nd. `x%2==y%2`: This checks if both x and y have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\n### Answer\nOption a: `x%2==0 && (y+1)%2!=0` is the correct answer.\n\nActually, let me double-check option a:\n- If y is even, then (y+1) is odd, so (y+1)%2!=0 is true\n- So the expression becomes x%2==0 && true, which simplifies to x%2==0\n\nBut this only checks if x is even, not both x and y.\n\nRe-examining option d: `x%2==y%2`\n- If x and y are both even, then x%2==0 and y%2==0, so x%2==y%2 is true\n- If x and y are both odd, then x%2==1 and y%2==1, so x%2==y%2 is also true\n\nTherefore, option d doesn't uniquely identify when both are even.\n\nLooking at option c again: `(x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0`\n- If both x and y are even, then x+y is even and x-y is even\n- If both x and y are odd, then x+y is even but x-y is even too\n- If one is even and one is odd, then x+y is odd and x-y is odd\n\nSo option c is true only when both x and y have the same parity.\n\nLet's correct option a: `x%2==0 && y%2==0` would check if both are even.\n\nThe correct answer is d: `x%2==y%2`\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2021\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to understand the recursive function f(n,c) and determine which input values would result in a specific output value (which is not given in the problem).\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the function f(n,c):\n1. If n equals 0, it returns 0.\n2. If the last digit of n equals c, it ignores that digit and recursively calls f with n/10.\n3. Otherwise, it keeps the last digit of n and adds it to 10 times the result of the recursive call.\n\nIn essence, this function removes all occurrences of digit c from number n.\n\n### Answer\nTo determine which option is correct, I need to evaluate each:\n\na. f(2021, 0) = 2 + 10*(2 + 10*(0)) = 2 + 10*20 = 2 + 200 = 202\nb. f(200211, 2) = 1 + 10*(1 + 10*(0 + 10*(0))) = 1 + 10*101 = 1 + 1010 = 1011\nc. f(312032, 3) = 2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2 + 10*(1))) = 2 + 10*102 = 2 + 1020 = 1022\nd. f(720721, 7) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*(0 + 10*(2))) = 1 + 10*202 = 1 + 2020 = 2021\n\nThe answer is option d: n=720721 and c=7, which gives f(n,c) = 2021.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the expression that correctly accesses an element on the secondary diagonal of a 2D array.\n\n### Solution Approach\nIn a square matrix of size n×n (indexed from 0 to n-1), the elements on the secondary diagonal have the property that the sum of their indices (row + column) equals n-1. So for any element on the secondary diagonal, if its row index is i, its column index must be (n-1-i).\n\nGiven a 100×100 matrix (indexed 0 to 99), for any element on the secondary diagonal, i + j = 99.\n\n### Answer\nLooking at the options:\na. m[42/42] - This evaluates to m[1], which is incorrect\nb. m[42|42] - This uses bitwise OR, not matrix indexing\nc. m[42]:[57] - This is not valid C/C++ syntax\nd. m[42][57] - Let's check: 42 + 57 = 99, which satisfies our condition\n\nThe correct answer is option d: m[42][57]\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify an elementary cycle in the given undirected graph with 6 nodes and edges [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5], [5,6].\n\n### Solution Approach\nAn elementary cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated vertices except for the first/last one.\n\nLet's check each option:\na. 1,2,3 - This is not a cycle as it doesn't return to the starting vertex.\nb. 1,2,3,1 - This forms a cycle: 1→2→3→1 (using edges [1,2], [2,3], [1,3])\nc. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1 - This is not an elementary cycle as vertex 3 appears twice.\nd. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1 - This is not a cycle as there's no edge connecting vertices 6 and 1.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is option b: 1,2,3,1\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the minimum number of nodes on level 3 of a tree where:\n1. All nodes on the same level have the same number of children\n2. No two different levels have the same number of nodes\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children per node on level i as c_i.\n- Level 0 has 1 node (the root)\n- Level 1 has c_0 nodes\n- Level 2 has c_0 * c_1 nodes\n- Level 3 has c_0 * c_1 * c_2 nodes\n\nSince no two levels can have the same number of nodes, we need to ensure that:\n1 ≠ c_0 ≠ c_0*c_1 ≠ c_0*c_1*c_2\n\nLet's try to find the minimum number of nodes on level 3:\n- If c_0 = 2, level 1 has 2 nodes\n- If c_1 = 2, level 2 has 2*2 = 4 nodes\n- If c_2 = 2, level 3 has 2*2*2 = 8 nodes\n\nThis works because 1 ≠ 2 ≠ 4 ≠ 8, so all levels have different numbers of nodes.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of nodes on level 3 is 8, corresponding to option c.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nI need to analyze the given pseudocode algorithm that works with two natural numbers x and y, and determine what it outputs for specific inputs.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet me trace through the algorithm step by step:\n1. Read x and y\n2. If x > y, swap x and y\n3. Initialize nr = 1\n4. Loop from i = y down to x with step -1:\n   - Print 1\n   - If nr ≥ x, print 2\n   - Multiply nr by 3\n   - Print 1\n\n#### Part a: Execution for x=8, y=5\nSince x=8 > y=5, we swap, so x=5 and y=8\nnr = 1\nLoop from i=8 down to 5:\n\ni=8:\n- Print 1\n- nr=1 < x=5, so don't print 2\n- nr = 1*3 = 3\n- Print 1\n\ni=7:\n- Print 1\n- nr=3 < x=5, so don't print 2\n- nr = 3*3 = 9\n- Print 1\n\ni=6:\n- Print 1\n- nr=9 ≥ x=5, so print 2\n- nr = 9*3 = 27\n- Print 1\n\ni=5:\n- Print 1\n- nr=27 ≥ x=5, so print 2\n- nr = 27*3 = 81\n- Print 1\n\nOutput: 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n#### Part b: If x=10, find two values for y such that the digit 2 is printed exactly 3 times\nFor digit 2 to be printed, we need nr ≥ x (which is 10). \nLet's analyze how nr grows: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561...\nnr becomes ≥ 10 after the 4th iteration (when nr=27).\nSo for any y, the digit 2 will be printed at most (y-x+1) times.\n\nIf we need exactly 3 instances of digit 2, we need (y-10+1) = 3, which gives y=12.\nAlso, we could have y=15, which would give us (15-10+1) = 6 iterations, but digit 2 would be printed only when nr ≥ 10, which happens after 4 iterations. So in iterations 4, 5, and 6, digit 2 would be printed.\n\n#### Part c: C++ program for the algorithm\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y, nr, i;\n    \n    // Read input\n    cin >> x >> y;\n    \n    // Swap if x > y\n    if (x > y) {\n        int temp = x;\n        x = y;\n        y = temp;\n    }\n    \n    nr = 1;\n    \n    // Loop from y down to x\n    for (i = y; i >= x; i--) {\n        cout << \"1 \";\n        \n        if (nr >= x) {\n            cout << \"2 \";\n        }\n        \n        nr = nr * 3;\n        cout << \"1 \";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n#### Part d: Equivalent algorithm with while loop\n```\ncitește x,y\n (numere naturale nenule)\ndacă x>y atunci xy\nnr1\niy\ncât timp i>=x execută\n    scrie 1\n    dacă nr≥x atunci\n        scrie 2\n    nr <- nr*3\n    scrie 1\n    i <- i-1\n```\n\n### Answer\na. Output for x=8, y=5: 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1\nb. Two values for y when x=10: y=12 and y=15\nc. C++ program provided above\nd. Pseudocode with while loop provided above\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify the next two solutions generated using backtracking for groups of at least two singing birds from a set of five birds, where the nightingale and blackbird cannot be in the same group.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's identify the birds by their first letter for simplicity:\nC = cinteză (finch)\nCi = ciocârlie (lark)\nM = mierlă (blackbird)\nP = privighetoare (nightingale)\nS = scatiu (siskin)\n\nThe constraint is that M and P cannot appear in the same group.\n\nThe first four solutions given are:\n1. (C, Ci)\n2. (C, Ci, M)\n3. (C, Ci, M, S)\n4. (C, Ci, P)\n\nTo determine the next solutions, I need to understand the generation order. It seems to follow lexicographic order with birds added one by one.\n\nThe next solutions after (C, Ci, P) would be:\n5. (C, Ci, P, S)\n6. (C, Ci, S)\n7. (C, Ci, S, M) - M and P constraint applies\n8. (C, M)\n9. (C, M, S)\n10. (C, P)\n...\n\nAnd the sequence continues.\n\nHowever, we need to find the solutions that come after (Ci, P, S). Let's continue the sequence:\n- (Ci, S)\n- (Ci, S, M)\n- (M, P) - This is invalid due to the constraint\n- (M, S)\n- (M, S, P) - This is invalid due to the constraint\n- (P, S)\n\n### Answer\nThe next two solutions after (Ci, P, S) are:\n1. (Ci, S)\n2. (Ci, S, M)\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to calculate the result of subtracting the fraction stored in variable f from the fraction 2020/2021, and store the result in variable fs.\n\n### Solution Approach\nTo subtract fractions, we need a common denominator.\nThe result of (a/b) - (c/d) is (a*d - b*c)/(b*d).\n\nFor our problem:\n- The first fraction is 2020/2021\n- The second fraction is f.a/f.b\n\nSo the result is (2020*f.b - 2021*f.a)/(2021*f.b)\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nfs.b = 2021 * f.b;\nfs.a = 2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a;\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to create a function that calculates the sum of prime divisors of a number n that appear at an odd power in its prime factorization.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll check for each prime number p from 2 up to sqrt(n):\n1. If p divides n, we count how many times it does\n2. If the count is odd, we add p to the sum\n\nFor efficiency, we'll use trial division up to sqrt(n), and handle the case where n has a prime factor greater than sqrt(n) separately.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nvoid divPrim(long long n, int &s) {\n    s = 0;\n    \n    // Check for divisibility by 2\n    int count = 0;\n    while (n % 2 == 0) {\n        count++;\n        n /= 2;\n    }\n    if (count % 2 == 1) {\n        s += 2;\n    }\n    \n    // Check for divisibility by odd numbers\n    for (long long i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {\n        count = 0;\n        while (n % i == 0) {\n            count++;\n            n /= i;\n        }\n        if (count % 2 == 1) {\n            s += i;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // If n is a prime number greater than sqrt(original n)\n    if (n > 1) {\n        s += n;  // It appears with power 1, which is odd\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to create a program that reads n words and k, then displays the first k words that end with a vowel. If there aren't k such words, display \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read n and k\n2. Read n words one by one\n3. Check if each word ends with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)\n4. If yes, display it and decrement k\n5. If k becomes 0, we've found enough words\n6. If we've processed all n words and k > 0, display \"nu exista\"\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool isVowel(char c) {\n    return (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u');\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    string word;\n    \n    cin >> n >> k;\n    \n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cin >> word;\n        \n        if (!word.empty() && isVowel(word[word.length() - 1])) {\n            cout << word << endl;\n            count++;\n            \n            if (count == k) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if (count < k) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\" << endl;\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the last two consecutive terms in a sequence that have a given number x as their suffix. A number a is a suffix of b if b can be obtained by adding digits to the left of a.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read the value x from the file\n2. Process each number in the sequence\n3. Check if the current number has x as a suffix\n4. Keep track of the last two numbers that satisfy this condition\n5. Display the result or \"nu exista\" if less than 2 such numbers are found\n\nTo check if x is a suffix of a number y, we can:\n1. Convert both to strings and check if y ends with x, or\n2. Use arithmetic: x is a suffix of y if y % 10^(number of digits in x) = x\n\nThe second approach is more efficient as it avoids string conversions.\n\n### Answer\n\na. Algorithm description:\n1. Read x from the first line of the file\n2. Initialize variables to store the last two numbers with suffix x\n3. Calculate the power of 10 needed to check suffixes (10^number of digits in x)\n4. Process each number from the second line\n5. Check if the current number has x as a suffix using modulo operation\n6. Update the last two numbers if condition is met\n7. Output the result or \"nu exista\"\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n- It uses constant extra memory regardless of input size\n- It processes each number only once (O(n) time complexity)\n- It uses arithmetic operations instead of string manipulations for suffix checking\n\nb. C++ implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x, num;\n    int last1 = -1, last2 = -1; // Store the last two numbers with suffix x\n    \n    // Read x\n    fin >> x;\n    \n    // Calculate 10^(number of digits in x) for suffix checking\n    int power = 1;\n    int temp = x;\n    while (temp > 0) {\n        power *= 10;\n        temp /= 10;\n    }\n    \n    // Process each number\n    while (fin >> num) {\n        if (num % power == x) {\n            last1 = last2;\n            last2 = num;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Output result\n    if (last1 != -1) {\n        cout << last1 << \" \" << last2;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```",
    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.8": "Okay, here's the breakdown and solutions for each exercise, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks for a C/C++ expression that evaluates to 1 (true) if and only if both integer variables `x` and `y` are even numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA number is even if it is divisible by 2, leaving a remainder of 0. The modulo operator (`%`) gives the remainder of a division.  We need to check if both `x` and `y` have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.\n\n### Answer\nd. `x%2==y%2`\n\nThis is the best and correct answer.  It can also be solved by a. `x % 2 == 0 && (y + 1) % 2 != 0`, but option d is more succint. Options b and c are incorrect, as they combine operations that do not directly and correctly relate to even numbers.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a recursive function `f(n, c)` and need to find pairs of `n` and `c` for which the function returns 2021. The function processes the digits of `n`. If a digit equals `c`, that digit is effectively removed. Otherwise, the digit is added to 10 times the result of the recursive call.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the function's behavior:\n1.  **Base Case:** If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.\n2.  **Digit Removal:** If `n % 10 == c`, the function calls itself with `n / 10`, effectively removing the last digit if it matches `c`.\n3.  **Digit Processing:** If `n % 10 != c`, the function returns `n % 10 + 10 * f(n / 10, c)`. This adds the last digit to 10 times the result of the recursive call.\n\nWe need to consider how to get the result. We'll test each provided option.\n\n### Answer\nLet's analyze all options:\n\n*   **a. n=2021 și c=0:**\n    *   f(2021, 0) = 1 + 10 * f(202, 0)\n    *   f(202, 0) = 2 + 10 * f(20, 0)\n    *   f(20, 0) = 2 + 10*f(2,0)\n    *   f(2,0) = 2 + 10*f(0,0) = 2 + 10* 0 = 2\n    *   f(20, 0) = 2 + 10 * 2 = 22\n    *   f(202, 0) = 2 + 10*22 = 222\n    *   f(2021, 0) = 1 + 10 * 222 = 2221. Incorrect.\n\n*   **b. n=200211 și c=2:**\n    *   f(200211, 2) = 1 + 10 * f(20021, 2)\n    *   f(20021, 2) = 1 + 10 * f(2002, 2)\n    *   f(2002,2) = f(200,2)\n    *   f(200,2) = f(20,2) = f(2,2) = f(0,2) = 0\n    *   f(2002,2) = 0\n    *   f(20021, 2) = 1 + 10 * 0 = 1\n    *   f(200211, 2) = 1 + 10 * 1 = 11. Incorrect.\n\n*   **c. n=312032 și c=3:**\n    *   f(312032, 3) = 2 + 10 * f(31203, 3)\n    *   f(31203,3) = f(3120,3)\n    *   f(3120,3) = 0 + 10 * f(312,3)\n    *   f(312,3) = 2 + 10 * f(31,3)\n    *   f(31,3) = 1 + 10 * f(3,3) = 1 + 10 * f(0,3) = 1\n    *   f(312,3) = 2 + 10 * 1 = 22\n    *   f(3120,3) = 0 + 10*22 = 220\n    *   f(31203,3) = 220\n    *   f(312032,3) = 2 + 10*220 = 2202. Incorrect\n\n* **d. n=720721 and c=7**\n   *    f(720721,7) = 1 + 10 * f(72072,7)\n   *    f(72072,7) = 2 + 10 * f(7207,7) = 2 + 10 * f(720,7)\n   *    f(720,7) = 0 + 10* f(72,7) = 10 * f(72,7)\n   *    f(72,7) = 2 + 10*f(7,7) = 2 + 10*f(0,7) = 2\n   *    f(720,7) = 10*2=20\n   *    f(72072,7) = 2 + 10*20=202\n   *    f(720721,7) = 1 + 10*202 = 2021. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **d. n=720721 și c=7**\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks for the C/C++ expression to access an element on the secondary diagonal of a 100x100 two-dimensional array `m`.  The array indices range from 0 to 99.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe secondary diagonal of a matrix consists of elements where the sum of the row and column indices is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the size of the square matrix (number of rows or columns). In this case, n = 100.  Therefore, for an element on the secondary diagonal, `row + col = 99`. Given row `42`, the corresponding column would be `99 - 42 = 57`.\n\n### Answer\nd. `m[42][57]`\n\n### Code Solution (Not strictly needed, but for illustration)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n  int m[100][100];\n  // Example: Accessing an element on the secondary diagonal\n  int row = 42;\n  int col = 99 - row; // Calculate column index for secondary diagonal\n  m[row][col] = 10;  // Assign a value to the element\n\n  std::cout << \"Element on secondary diagonal at [\" << row << \"][\" << col << \"]: \" << m[row][col] << std::endl;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe're given an undirected graph with 6 nodes and a list of edges. We need to identify an *elementary cycle* in the graph. An elementary cycle is a cycle where no node is visited more than once, except for the starting/ending node.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's list the edges:\n1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 3-4, 3-5, 4-5, 5-6\n\nWe'll examine each option:\n\n*   **a. 1,2,3:** This is a path, but not a cycle (doesn't return to the starting node).\n*   **b. 1,2,3,1:**  This is a cycle, and no node is repeated except the start/end.  This is a valid elementary cycle.\n*   **c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1:** This is a cycle, but node 3 is repeated.  Not an elementary cycle.\n*   **d. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1:** This is a cycle. Let's examine if all edges exist: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-1. The edge 6-1 does *not* exist in the given graph.  Therefore, this is not a valid cycle in the given graph.\n\n### Answer\nc. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1 is not an elementary cycle because node 3 is repeated.\nb. 1,2,3,1 is the correct answer.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a rooted tree with specific properties:\n1.  All nodes on the same level have the same number of children (\"fii\").\n2.  No two different levels have the same number of nodes.\nWe need to find the minimum number of nodes on level 3.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children of nodes at level `i` as `c_i`. The number of nodes at level `i` is `n_i`.\n\n*   Level 0: `n_0 = 1` (the root)\n*   Level 1: `n_1 = n_0 * c_0 = c_0`\n*   Level 2: `n_2 = n_1 * c_1 = c_0 * c_1`\n*   Level 3: `n_3 = n_2 * c_2 = c_0 * c_1 * c_2`\n\nSince no two levels can have the same number of nodes, `c_0`, `c_1`, and `c_2` must be distinct integers, and none of them can be 1 (otherwise, two adjacent levels would have the same number of nodes). We want to minimize `n_3`, so we should choose the smallest possible distinct values for `c_0`, `c_1`, and `c_2`, greater than 1.\n\nThe smallest values are 2, 3, and 4. We can pick them in any order; the product will be the same.\nn_3 = 2*3*4\n\nAnother possible combination is 2,3, and any other number greater than 1.\n\n### Answer\nThe minimum number of children each node must have on levels 0, 1 and 2 are 2, 3 and 4.\nLevel 0 has 1 node.\nLevel 1 must have at least 2 nodes.\nLevel 2, since it can't have the same number of nodes as level 1, and all nodes on level 1 have the same number of children, means level 2 must have at least 2 * 3 = 6 nodes.\nLevel 3, to be different to all previous levels will be at least. 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 nodes.\nIf we pick 4 as the children of level 0, level 1 will have 4 nodes.\nLevel 2 will have 4*2=8 nodes.\nLevel 3 will have 8*3 = 24.\n\nHowever, if the number of children of the root node is 2, the next level has 2 nodes. If the number of children of level 1 nodes is 3, Level 2 would have 2*3=6 nodes. If level 3 nodes have 4 children each. Number of nodes at level 3 = 6*4 = 24.\nIf root has 3 children, level 1 has 3 nodes. Children on Level 1 can be 2. So level 2 has 3*2=6. Level 3 will have 6 * 4 = 24 nodes.\nIf the number of children for level 0, 1 and 2 is 4,3,2, then number of nodes at level 3 = (1 * 4 * 3) * 2= 24.\nIf the number of children are 4, 2, 3. Number of nodes = 1*4*2*3=24.\n\nIf we have 2 children on level 0. 1 * 2 = 2\nIf we have 4 children on level 1, we have 2*4=8 nodes.\nIf we have 3 children at level 2, we have = 8 * 3 = 24 nodes on Level 3.\n\nLet the root have 2 children. n1 = 2\nLevel 1 nodes have 3 children. n2 = 2*3 = 6.\nLevel 2 nodes have 4 children. n3 = 6 * 4. = 24.\n\nHowever, it says that number of nodes on two levels cannot be the same.\nLevel 0: 1 node\nLevel 1: 2 nodes (root has 2 children)\nLevel 2: 3 * 2 = 6 nodes (level 1 has 3 children each)\nLevel 3 = 6 * 4 = 24 nodes\n\nNone of the provided answers are correct. 2,3, 4 would result to minimum number of 24. The smallest valid number would be obtained by using the three smallest different values for the multiplying factor.\nBut if level 0 has 2 nodes: level 1.\nLevel 1 nodes have 4 children each. Level 2: 2*4 = 8 nodes\nLevel 3 can't have 2 nodes.\n\nRoot: 1\nL1 : 2\nL2: 6\nL3: 24\n\nThe problem statement says all the nodes at the same level have the same number of children. So, root having 2 children means Level 1 will have 2 nodes. Level 1 nodes having 3 children each: Level 2 = 6 nodes. Level 2: 6 nodes, and each has 4 children. Level 3 = 6*4=24. The closest option is a,b,c.\n\nThe correct calculation:\nLevel 0: 1 node\nLevel 1:  1 * 2 = 2\nLevel 2:  2 * 3 = 6\nLevel 3 : 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nNone of the options are correct. The minimum should be 24.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm takes two natural numbers, `x` and `y`, as input. It swaps them if `x > y`. Then, it iterates from `y` down to `x` (inclusive), printing '1' in each iteration.  Inside the loop, it checks if `nr` is greater than or equal to `x`. If it is, it prints '2'. `nr` is initialized to 1 and multiplied by 3 in each iteration. Finally, it prints '1' after the inner `if` statement.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll trace the algorithm for the given inputs and then generalize for part (b). For part (c), we translate the pseudocode to C++, and for part (d), we rewrite it using a `while` loop.\n\n### Answer\n**a.**  `x = 8`, `y = 5`\n\n1.  `x` and `y` are swapped: `x = 5`, `y = 8`\n2.  `nr = 1`\n3.  Loop from `i = 8` down to `5`:\n    *   `i = 8`: prints '1', `nr` (1) < `x` (5), prints '1'. `nr = 3`\n    *   `i = 7`: prints '1', `nr` (3) < `x` (5), prints '1'. `nr = 9`\n    *   `i = 6`: prints '1', `nr` (9) >= `x` (5), prints '2', prints '1'. `nr = 27`\n    *   `i = 5`: prints '1', `nr` (27) >= `x` (5), prints '2', prints '1'. `nr = 81`\n\nOutput: `1111121121`\n\n**b.** `x = 10`, find two values for `y` such that '2' is printed only three times.\n\nWe need `nr` to be >= 10 three times during the loop. Since `nr` is multiplied by 3 in each iteration, the values of nr inside the loop are: 1,3,9,27,81....\n\nIf y = 10, loop runs from 10 to 10. Nr starts at 1. The loop is:\n1, 2 is not printed.\nIf y = 9, loop runs from 9 to 10.\nLoop1 : Prints 1, 1. nr=3\nLoop2: Prints 1,1. nr=9\nIf y=8, Loop runs from 8 to 10.\n1,1 nr=3\n1,1 nr=9\n1,2,1 nr=27. 2 appears only once.\nIf y = 7, loop runs from 7 to 10:\n1, 1 nr =3\n1, 1 nr = 9\n1, 2, 1 nr=27\n1,2,1 nr=81.\n\nWe need to make `nr` >= 10 three times during the loop that goes from y to x.\nIf y=1, the values of i are 1 to 10:\nIf i=1, nr=1\nIf i=2, nr=3.\nif i=3, nr=9\nif i=4, nr=27, 2 is printed.\nIf i=5, nr=81,\n...\n\nLet's try y=1. The loop runs from 1 to 10. 2 is displayed when nr >= 10, and nr = nr * 3.\ny=1: loop runs from 1 to 10.\nNr = 1,3,9,27,81, 243, 729...\n2 will be displayed when nr is greater than or equal to x.\nIf y=2: Loop runs from 2 to 10.\nnr: 1,3,9,27,81,... 2 is displayed more than 3 times.\n\nIf y = 4: Loop runs from 4 to 10, nr = 1\ni=4: prints 1, nr = 1, prints 1, nr=3\ni=3: prints 1, nr=3, prints 1, nr=9\ni=2: Prints 1, nr=9, prints 1, nr=27.\ni=1, prints 1, nr=27, prints 2, prints 1, nr = 81.\n\nConsider y=3. Then loop will go from 3 to 10.\n- i=3: 1, nr=1, 1, nr=3\n- i=2: 1, nr=3, 1, nr=9\n- i=1: 1, nr=9, 1, nr=27. 2 is printed, since nr >= 10.\n\nTwo possible values are y = 1 and y = 2.\n\nIf y=1:\nThe loop goes from 1 to 10:\nThe values of nr in the loop are 1,3,9,27...  2 is displayed for 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\nIf y=2. Loop runs from 2 to 10.\nnr = 1,3,9,27... 2 is displayed for many values.\n\nIf y = 3. Loop is from 3 to 10.\nnr = 1,3,9,27,...\nIf we want 2 to appear 3 times.\n\nTry y = 4. Loop is from 4 to 10.\nnr = 1,3,9,27,81...\nIf y=4: Nr=1, 3, 9, 27, 81... 2 will appear more than 3 times.\nIf y = 1: Loop will run from 1 to 10.\nnr = 1,3,9,27, 81, 243.\nnr>=10, 2 is printed.\n\nIf y=2.

We're given the first four solutions and need to find the next two after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll follow the backtracking order, keeping in mind the constraint. The birds are: cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, privighetoare, scatiu.\n\n1.  (cinteză, ciocârlie)\n2.  (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă)\n3.  (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu)\n4.  (cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare)\n5.  (cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu)\n6.  (cinteză, ciocârlie, scatiu)\n7.  (cinteză, mierlă)\n8.  (cinteză, mierlă, scatiu)\n9.  (cinteză, privighetoare)\n10. (cinteză, privighetoare, scatiu)\n11. (cinteză, scatiu)\n12. (ciocârlie, mierlă)\n13. (ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu)\n14. (ciocârlie, privighetoare)\n15. (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu)\n\n### Answer\nThe next two solutions after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu) are:\n\n1.  (ciocârlie, scatiu)\n2.  (mierlă, scatiu)\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have two `fractie` variables, `f` and `fs`. `f` stores a fraction (numerator in `a`, denominator in `b`). We need to store in `fs` the result of subtracting the fraction in `f` from 2020/2021, *without* using any additional variables.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe subtraction is:  (2020/2021) - (f.a / f.b).  To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator, which will be 2021 * f.b.\n\n1.  The new numerator will be (2020 * f.b) - (2021 * f.a).\n2.  The new denominator will be 2021 * f.b.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nfs.a = 2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a;\nfs.b = 2021 * f.b;\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function `divPrim(n, s)` that calculates the sum (`s`) of the prime divisors of `n` that appear with an odd power in the prime factorization of `n`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Iterate through potential divisors `d` from 2 up to the square root of `n`.\n2.  For each `d`, check if it's a divisor of `n`.\n3.  If `d` is a divisor, count its power (`p`) in the factorization of `n`.\n4.  If `d` is prime and `p` is odd, add `d` to the sum `s`.\n5.  After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 1, it means `n` itself is a prime factor (and its power is 1, which is odd), so add `n` to `s`.\n6. Initialize s to 0.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid divPrim(int n, int& s) {\n  s = 0;\n  int d = 2;\n  while (n > 1 && d * d <= n) {\n    int p = 0;\n    while (n % d == 0) {\n      ++p;\n      n /= d;\n    }\n    if (p % 2 != 0) {\n      s += d;\n    }\n    ++d;\n  }\n  if (n > 1) {\n    s += n;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int n, s;\n\n  n = 360;\n  divPrim(n, s);\n  std::cout << \"n = 360, s = \" << s << std::endl; // Output: 7\n\n  n = 16;\n  divPrim(n, s);\n  std::cout << \"n = 16, s = \" << s << std::endl;  // Output: 0\n\n    n = 2*3*5*5*7;\n    divPrim(n,s);\n    std::cout << \"n = 2*3*5*5*7, s = \" << s << std::endl;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe program reads `n` words and an integer `k`. It needs to print the first `k` words that end with a vowel, or \"nu exista\" if there aren't `k` such words.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read `n` words one by one.\n3.  For each word, check if its last character is a vowel.\n4.  If it is, print the word and decrement `k`.\n5.  If `k` reaches 0, stop.\n6. If after reading all words `k` is not zero, output \"nu exista\"\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n  int n, k;\n  std::cin >> n >> k;\n  std::cin.ignore(); // Consume the newline after reading k\n\n  int count = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n    std::string word;\n    std::getline(std::cin, word); // Read the entire line as a word\n\n    if (!word.empty()) {\n      char lastChar = word[word.length() - 1];\n      if (lastChar == 'a' || lastChar == 'e' || lastChar == 'i' ||\n          lastChar == 'o' || lastChar == 'u') {\n        std::cout << word << std::endl;\n        count++;\n        if(count==k) break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (count < k) {\n    std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe program reads a number `x` and a sequence of numbers from a file. It needs to find the last two consecutive numbers in the sequence that have `x` as a suffix.  Efficiency in terms of memory and time is crucial.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `x` from the first line of the file.\n2.  Read the numbers from the second line one by one.\n3.  Keep track of the two most recent numbers that have `x` as a suffix (`prev1` and `prev2`).\n4.  To check for a suffix, we can use the modulo operator. If `num % (10^digits_of_x) == x`. We precalculate 10^digits.\n5.  If no such pair is found, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Answer\n**a. Algorithm Description:**\n\n1.  Read the value of `x` from the file.\n2.  Calculate `pow10`, which is 10 raised to the power of the number of digits in `x`. This is used for the suffix check.\n3.  Initialize `prev1` and `prev2` to -1 (indicating no valid numbers found yet).\n4.  Read numbers from the file one by one.\n5.  For each number `current`, check if it has `x` as a suffix using the modulo operation: `current % pow10 == x`.\n6.  If `current` has `x` as a suffix:\n    *   Update `prev1` with the previous value of `prev2`.\n    *   Update `prev2` with `current`.\n7.  After reading all numbers, check if `prev1` and `prev2` are still -1.\n    *   If they are, print \"nu exista\".\n    *   Otherwise, print `prev1` and `prev2`.\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n\n*   **Memory:** It only stores three numbers at a time (`current`, `prev1`, `prev2`) and the value of x and pow10, regardless of the length of the sequence.  This is constant memory usage (O(1)).\n*   **Time:** It reads the file sequentially once, performing a constant-time check (modulo operation) for each number.  This is linear time complexity (O(N)), where N is the number of elements in the sequence.\n\n**b. Code Solution:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nint main() {\n  std::ifstream inputFile(\"bac.txt\");\n  int x, current, prev1 = -1, prev2 = -1;\n\n  inputFile >> x;\n\n  int tempX = x;\n  int digits = 0;\n    if (tempX == 0) digits = 1;\n    else {\n        while (tempX > 0) {\n            tempX /= 10;\n            digits++;\n        }\n    }\n  int pow10 = 1;\n    for(int i=0; i<digits; ++i) pow10*=10;\n\n  while (inputFile >> current) {\n    if (current % pow10 == x) {\n      prev1 = prev2;\n      prev2 = current;\n    }\n  }\n\n  inputFile.close();\n\n  if (prev1 != -1 && prev2 != -1) {\n    std::cout << prev1 << \" \" << prev2 << std::endl;\n  } else {\n    std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n"
