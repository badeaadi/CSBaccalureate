We can use the modulo operator (`%`) to check this. We need to ensure *both* `x` and `y` satisfy this condition.\n\n### Answer\n**d. x%2==y%2**\n\nThis answer is the best, most efficient, and most readable. While (c) also produces a correct result, (d) is the most straightforward.\n(a) checks if x is even and y is odd\n(b) checks if the difference between x and y is divisible by 2, it only checks that x and y are both even or both odd.\n(c) checks if the sum and the difference of x and y are even, which means x and y are both even or both odd.\n(d) checks if the remainders of x and y divided by 2 are equal, which means x and y are both even or both odd. However, if we change the condition into x%2 == 0 && y%2 == 0, it will be more precise and readable. In this case, all options would be correct, but (d) is the most concise.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find values for `n` and `c` such that the recursive function `f(n, c)` returns 2021. The function processes the digits of `n` from right to left. If a digit equals `c`, it's skipped. Otherwise, the digit is added to 10 times the result of the recursive call with the remaining digits.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze the function's behavior:\n\n*   `if (n == 0) return 0;`: Base case - if `n` is 0, the function returns 0.\n*   `if (n % 10 == c) return f(n / 10, c);`: If the last digit of `n` is equal to `c`, the function recurses with `n` without its last digit, effectively ignoring the digit `c`.\n*   `else return n % 10 + 10 * f(n / 10, c);`: If the last digit of `n` is *not* equal to `c`, the function adds the last digit to 10 times the result of the recursive call. This effectively reconstructs the number `n` but omits the digits equal to `c`.\n\nWe need f(n,c) = 2021. We examine each option.\n\n### Answer\n\n*   **a. n=2021 și c=0:**  f(2021, 0) = 1 + 10*f(202,0) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*f(20,0)) = 1 + 10 * (2 + 10*(2+10*f(2,0))) = 1 + 20 + 200 + 2000 = 2221. Incorrect.\n*   **b. n=200211 și c=2:** f(200211, 2) = 1 + 10*f(20021,2) = 1 + 10*(1+10*f(2002,2)) = 1 + 10 + 100*f(200,2) = 1 + 10 + 0 + 1000*f(2,2) = 11. Incorrect.\n*   **c. n=312032 și c=3:** f(312032, 3) = 2 + 10*f(31203,3) = 2+10*(0 + 10*f(3120,3)) = 2 + 10*(0+10*(2+10*(1+10*f(3,3))))= 2 + 200 + 1000 = 1202. Incorrect.\n*   **d. n=720721 și c=7:** f(720721, 7) = 1 + 10*f(72072,7) = 1 + 10*(2 + 10*f(7207,7)) = 1+20+0+2000 = 2021. Correct.\n\n**d. n=720721 și c=7**\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a 100x100 two-dimensional array (matrix) `m`. We need to find the C/C++ expression to access an element on the secondary diagonal.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe secondary diagonal of a square matrix consists of elements where the sum of the row index and column index is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of rows (or columns). In this case, `n = 100`.  So, for an element on the secondary diagonal, `row + col = 99`.  Given a row index `i`, the column index `j` on the secondary diagonal will be `j = 99 - i`.  The provided options suggest we are looking at element where row = 42. The question asks for a general expression.\n\n### Answer\n**d. m[42][57]**\n\nIf the row is 42, the column on the secondary diagonal must be 99 - 42 = 57.  Therefore, `m[42][57]` accesses the element at row 42, column 57, which lies on the secondary diagonal. The other options don't make sense in the context of array indexing.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given an undirected graph with 6 nodes and a list of edges. We need to identify an elementary cycle. An elementary cycle is a cycle where no node is visited more than once (except for the start/end node, which is the same).\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's list the edges:\n1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 3-4, 3-5, 4-5, 5-6\n\nWe examine each given option:\n\n### Answer\n\n*   **a. 1,2,3:** Not a cycle (doesn't return to the starting node).\n*   **b. 1,2,3,1:** This is a cycle.  It visits nodes 1, 2, and 3, and returns to 1. No node is repeated except the start/end.\n*   **c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1:** This is a cycle, but node 3 is repeated.  Not elementary.\n*   **d. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1:** This is a cycle, but it is not elementary, as we can not go directly from 6 to 1. There is no edge [6,1].\n\n**c. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1** is a cycle, but not elementary.\n\nThe correct elementary cycle is given by option b.\n\n**b. 1,2,3,1**\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a rooted tree where nodes on the same level have the same number of children, and no two levels have the same number of nodes. We need the minimum number of nodes on level 3.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children of nodes at level `i` as `c_i`.\n*   Level 0: 1 node (root)\n*   Level 1: `c_0` nodes (children of the root)\n*   Level 2: `c_0 * c_1` nodes\n*   Level 3: `c_0 * c_1 * c_2` nodes\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of `c_0 * c_1 * c_2` such that `c_0`, `c_1`, `c_2`, 1, `c_0`, `c_0 * c_1`, and `c_0 * c_1 * c_2` are all distinct.  We must also minimize `c_0 * c_1 * c_2`.\n\nWe can try small values for `c_0`, `c_1`, and `c_2`:\n- If c_0 = 1, there is only 1 node on level 1. This is the same number of nodes as on level 0, so this is not allowed.\n- c_0 must therefore be greater or equal to 2.\n- Let's try c_0 = 2.  Then level 1 has 2 nodes.\n- If c_1 = 1, level 2 has 2 nodes, same as level 1, so not allowed.\n    - c_1 must be different than 1 and 2 (number of nodes at level 0 and 1)\n    - Try c_1 = 3. Then Level 2 has 2*3=6 nodes\n        - c_2 must be different than 1, 2, 3, 6.\n        - Try c_2 = 4. Then level 3 has 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n        - Try c_2 = 5.  Then level 3 has 2*3*5 = 30.\n    - Try c_1 = 4. Then Level 2 has 2*4 = 8 nodes.\n        - c_2 could be 3. Then level 3 has 2*4*3 = 24 nodes.\n\n    - c_0=2, c_1 = 3, c_2 must be different from 1, 2, 3, 6. We can take c_2 = 4, and we get 2*3*4 = 24 nodes.\n    - c_0=3, Level 1 has 3 nodes. c_1 must be different from 1 and 3, so we could choose c_1=2. Then, level 2 has 6 nodes. c_2 must be different from 1,2,3,6. c_2 could be 4, so there would be 3*2*4=24 nodes on level 3.\n\nLet's try another approach. We need to find the smallest three distinct integers greater than 1. These are 2, 3, and 4 (or any permutation). We're looking for the smallest product of 3 distinct integers, each of them >1.\nIf we choose 2,3, and 4, we must multiply them. This gives 2*3*1 = 6 nodes on level 2, 2*3*4=24 nodes on level 3.\n\nConsider c_0=2, c_1=3.  Then level 1 has 2 nodes, level 2 has 6 nodes. c_2 cannot be 1, 2, 3, or 6.  If c_2 = 4, then level 3 has 2*3*4=24 nodes.\nIf c_0 = 2, c_1 must be at least 3.  So c_0 * c_1 is at least 6.\nIf c_2=1, level 3 will have the same number of nodes as level 2.\n\nIf we assign the smallest distinct integers greater than 1 to c0, c1, and c2.\nc0=2, c1=3, c2=4 -> 2*3*4 = 24\nc0=2, c1=4, c2=3 -> 2*4*3 = 24\nc0=3, c1=2, c2=4 -> 3*2*4 = 24\n\nIf Level 1 has 2 children, level 2 has 6, level 3 must have a different number of nodes.\n\nHowever, it turns out the minimal numbers are 2, 3. We can try 4, 5, etc. for the last one.\n2*3*4 = 24\n2*3*5 = 30\n\nThe question says all the nodes on the same level have the same number of \"fii\". It does NOT say that the number of \"fii\" should be different across different levels.\n\nLevel 0: 1 node\nLevel 1: c0 nodes (c0 > 1)\nLevel 2: c0 * c1 nodes (c1 > 1, c0*c1 != 1, c0*c1 != c0)\nLevel 3: c0 * c1 * c2 nodes (c2 > 1, c0*c1*c2 != 1, c0*c1*c2 != c0, c0*c1*c2 != c0*c1)\n\nConsider 2,3,4. Level 0: 1, Level 1: 2, Level 2: 2*3=6, Level 3: 2*3*4=24. This is valid.\n\nConsider 2, 3, 1. Not valid.\n\n### Answer\nNone of the given options are correct. The smallest possible number of nodes on Level 3 is 24.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm reads two natural numbers, `x` and `y`, swaps them if `x > y`, and then iterates from `y` down to `x` (inclusive). Inside the loop, it prints '1', then prints '2' if `nr` is greater than or equal to `x`, and finally multiplies `nr` by 3 and prints '1' again.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will trace the algorithm for the given inputs and then find inputs that satisfy the condition in part (b). For parts (c) and (d), we'll translate the pseudocode to C++ and modify the loop, respectively.\n\n### Answer\n\n**a.**  `x = 8`, `y = 5`\n\n1.  `x` and `y` are swapped: `x = 5`, `y = 8`\n2.  `nr = 1`\n3.  Loop from `i = 8` down to `5`:\n    *   `i = 8`: prints '1'. `nr` (1) is not >= `x` (5). `nr = 3`. Prints '1'.\n    *   `i = 7`: prints '1'. `nr` (3) is not >= `x` (5). `nr = 9`. Prints '1'.\n    *   `i = 6`: prints '1'. `nr` (9) is >= `x` (5). Prints '2'. `nr = 27`. Prints '1'.\n    *   `i = 5`: prints '1'. `nr` (27) is >= `x` (5). Prints '2'. `nr = 81`. Prints '1'.\n\nOutput: `1111121121`\n\n**b.**  `x = 10`, find two values for `y` such that '2' is printed exactly three times.\n\nThe '2' is printed when `nr >= x`.  `nr` is initialized to 1 and multiplied by 3 in each iteration. We want `nr` to be greater than or equal to 10 three times.\n- If y=10, the loop goes from 10 to 10. nr = 1. Prints 1, nr is not >= 10, nr=3, prints 1.\n- If x=10 and y=1, the loop will go from 1 to 10.\nnr=1\ni=1: 1, nr<10, nr=3, 1\ni=2: 1, nr<10, nr=9, 1\ni=3: 1, nr<10, nr=27, 1\ni=4: 1, nr>=10, 2, nr=81, 1.\n...\nWe need nr to reach >=10 on the third loop.\n1, 3, 9, 27...\nWe need the third value to be >=10, which is 27.\nWe want 3 iterations where nr >= x.\nLet's consider when nr will be >=10:\n- nr=1\n- nr=3\n- nr=9\n- nr=27\nIf y = 10, the loop executes once.\nIf y = 9, the loop runs from 9 to 10.\nIf y = 1, we have 1, 3, 9, 27, 81,...\n1. y=3:\nLoop from 3 to 10.\n1, nr < 10, nr=3, 1\n1, nr < 10, nr=9, 1\n1, nr < 10, nr=27, 1\n1, nr >= 10, 2, nr=81, 1\n1, nr >= 10, 2, nr=243, 1\n1, nr >= 10, 2, nr=729, 1\n...\nIf y=2, loop from 2 to 10\n1, nr=3, 1\n1, nr=9, 1\n1, nr=27, 2, 1\n...\nIf y=4.

We need to find the two solutions immediately after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll follow the backtracking order, keeping in mind the constraint. The given set is {cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, privighetoare, scatiu}. The given solutions are:\n1.  (cinteză, ciocârlie)\n2.  (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă)\n3.  (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu)\n4.  (cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare)\n5. (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu)\n\n### Answer\nFollowing the order, after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu), we cannot have mierla.\nThe next solutions are:\n1.  (mierlă, scatiu)\n2.   (scatiu) - this is not valid, as we need at least two birds.\n\nSo, we continue:\n6. (mierlă, scatiu)\n7. (scatiu) is not possible.\nSo, we have\n1. (cinteză, ciocârlie)\n2. (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă)\n3. (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu)\n4. (cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare)\n5. (cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu)\n6. (cinteză, mierlă)\n7. (cinteză, mierlă, scatiu)\n8. (cinteză, scatiu)\n9. (ciocârlie, mierlă)\n10. (ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu)\n11. (ciocârlie, privighetoare)\n12. (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu)\n13. (mierlă, scatiu)\n\nThe next two solutions are: (mierlă, scatiu)\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have two `fractie` variables, `f` and `fs`. `f` stores a fraction, and `fs` needs to store the result of subtracting `f` from 2020/2021.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe subtraction is (2020/2021) - (f.a/f.b).  We perform the subtraction:\n(2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a) / (2021 * f.b)\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\nfs.a = 2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a;\nfs.b = 2021 * f.b;\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe `divPrim` subprogram needs to calculate the sum of prime divisors of `n` that appear with an odd power in its prime factorization.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe iterate through potential divisors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. For each divisor, we check if it's prime and divides `n`. If it does, we count the power of that divisor in the factorization of `n`. If the power is odd, we add the divisor to the sum.  After checking all divisors up to the square root, if `n` is still greater than 1, it means `n` itself is a prime factor (with a power of 1, which is odd), so we add it to the sum.\n\n### Code Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid divPrim(int n, int& s) {\n    s = 0;\n    for (int d = 2; d * d <= n; ++d) {\n        if (n % d == 0) {\n            int power = 0;\n            while (n % d == 0) {\n                n /= d;\n                power++;\n            }\n            if (power % 2 != 0) {\n                s += d;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if (n > 1) {\n        s += n;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to read `n` words and then print the first `k` words ending with a vowel. If there are fewer than `k` such words, we print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe read the words one by one. For each word, we check if its last character is a vowel. If it is, we decrement `k` and print the word. We continue until we've either printed `k` words or read all `n` words. If `k` is still greater than 0 after reading all words, we print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Code Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nbool isVowel(char c) {\n    return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    std::cin >> n >> k;\n    std::cin.ignore(); \n\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        std::string word;\n        std::getline(std::cin, word); \n\n        if (!word.empty() && isVowel(word.back())) {\n            if (count < k){\n                std::cout << word << std::endl;\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (count < k) {\n        std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe're given a number `x` and a sequence of numbers in a file. We need to find the last two consecutive numbers in the sequence that have `x` as a suffix. We need an efficient algorithm in terms of memory and time.\n\n### Solution Approach\nSince we need only the *last* two such numbers, we don't need to store the entire sequence. We can read the numbers one by one. We'll keep track of the two most recent numbers that have `x` as a suffix.  A number `a` is a suffix of `b` if `b % (10^digits(a)) == a`. Since `x` is between 100 and 999, we can check if a number has x as a suffix by checking if the number mod 1000 is equal to x.\n\n### Answer\n\n**a. Algorithm Description:**\n\n1.  Read `x` from the first line of the file.\n2.  Initialize two variables, `prev` and `current`, to store the two most recent numbers with `x` as a suffix. Initialize them to -1 (or any value indicating they haven't been found yet).\n3.  Read numbers from the second line of the file one by one.\n4.  For each number `num` read:\n    *   Check if `num` has `x` as a suffix ( `num % 1000 == x`).\n    *   If it does, update `prev` with the value of `current`, and `current` with the value of `num`.\n5.  After reading all numbers, if both `prev` and `current` are still -1, print \"nu exista\".\n6.  Otherwise, print `prev` and `current`, separated by a space.\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n    *   **Memory:** It uses only a few integer variables, regardless of the length of the sequence.  It doesn't store the entire sequence.\n    *   **Time:** It reads the file only once, performing a constant-time check (modulo operation) for each number.\n\n**b. C++ Code:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream file(\"bac.txt\");\n    int x, num;\n    file >> x;\n\n    int prev = -1, current = -1;\n    while (file >> num) {\n        if (num % 1000 == x) {\n            prev = current;\n            current = num;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (prev != -1 && current != -1) {\n        std::cout << prev << \" \" << current << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"nu exista\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    file.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

An even number `n` satisfies `n % 2 == 0`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct expression is `d. x%2==y%2`. This expression evaluates to 1 if both `x` and `y` are even, as both will have `n % 2 == 0`.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int x = 4; // Example even number\n    int y = 6; // Example even number\n\n    if (x % 2 == y % 2) {\n        std::cout << \"Both numbers are even.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"At least one number is odd.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nAnalyze the subprogram `f` and determine which call results in a specific behavior based on the given options.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function `f` recursively processes the digits of `n`, ignoring digits equal to `c`.

It starts at 1, goes through 2, 3, 4, returns to 5, and then back to 3, and finally back to 1.\n\n### Code Solution\nNo code needed for this theoretical graph problem.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nDetermine the minimum number of nodes on level 3 of a tree with given properties.\n\n### Solution Approach\nEach level has a different number of nodes, and nodes at the same level have the same number of children.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is `a. 12`.

Let's analyze each option:\n- a: x%2==0 && (y+1)%2!=0 - This checks if x is even AND (y+1) is odd\n- b: (x-y)/2==0 - This checks if (x-y) is 0 or 1 (due to integer division)\n- c: (x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0 - This checks if both (x+y) and (x-y) are even\n- d: x%2==y%2 - This checks if x and y have the same parity (both even or both odd)\n\n### Answer\nOption c: (x+y)%2==0 && (x-y)%2==0\n\nThis is correct because:\n- If both x and y are even: x = 2k, y = 2m\n  - (x+y)%2 = (2k+2m)%2 = 0\n  - (x-y)%2 = (2k-2m)%2 = 0\n- If either x or y is odd, then either (x+y) or (x-y) will be odd, making the expression false.\n- If both x and y are odd, then both (x+y) and (x-y) are even, which would make the expression true when it should be false.\n\nOption d would be true if both x and y are even OR both x and y are odd, which doesn't match our requirement.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2021\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the recursive function f(n,c) and determine which input parameters will produce 2021 as the output.\n\n```cpp\nint f(int n,int c)\n{ if(n==0) return 0;\n else\n if(n%10==c) return f(n/10,c);\n else return n%10+10*f(n/10,c);\n}\n```\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function recursively processes digits of n:\n- If n is 0, return 0\n- If the last digit of n equals c, skip this digit and continue with n/10\n- Otherwise, include this digit in the result (n%10 + 10*recursive_result)\n\nEssentially, this function returns a number obtained by removing all occurrences of digit c from n.\n\n### Answer\nOption a: n=2021 and c=0\n\nLet's verify:\n- f(2021, 0) processes 1 (not equal to 0): result = 1 + 10*f(202, 0)\n- f(202, 0) processes 2 (not equal to 0): result = 2 + 10*f(20, 0)\n- f(20, 0) processes 0 (equal to 0): result = f(2, 0)\n- f(2, 0) processes 2 (not equal to 0): result = 2 + 10*f(0, 0)\n- f(0, 0) returns 0\n- So f(2, 0) = 2 + 10*0 = 2\n- f(20, 0) = 2\n- f(202, 0) = 2 + 10*2 = 22\n- f(2021, 0) = 1 + 10*22 = 1 + 220 = 221\n\nThis doesn't equal 2021, so option a is incorrect.\n\nLet's check option b: n=200211 and c=2\n- After removing all 2's, we get 0011 = 11\n\nLet's check option c: n=312032 and c=3\n- After removing all 3's, we get 12032\n\nLet's check option d: n=720721 and c=7\n- After removing all 7's, we get 20721\n\nRechecking option a with n=2021 and c=0:\n- After removing all 0's, we get 221\n\nNone of these match 2021. Let me trace through the options again more carefully...\n\nOption b: n=200211 and c=2\n- f(200211, 2) processes 1 (not equal to 2): 1 + 10*f(20021, 2)\n- f(20021, 2) processes 1 (not equal to 2): 1 + 10*f(2002, 2)\n- f(2002, 2) processes 2 (equal to 2): f(200, 2)\n- f(200, 2) processes 0 (not equal to 2): 0 + 10*f(20, 2)\n- f(20, 2) processes 0 (not equal to 2): 0 + 10*f(2, 2)\n- f(2, 2) processes 2 (equal to 2): f(0, 2)\n- f(0, 2) returns 0\n- So f(2, 2) = 0\n- f(20, 2) = 0\n- f(200, 2) = 0\n- f(2002, 2) = 0\n- f(20021, 2) = 1 + 10*0 = 1\n- f(200211, 2) = 1 + 10*1 = 11\n\nOption c: n=312032 and c=3\n- After removing all 3's: 1202\n- f(312032, 3) = 2 + 10*(f(31203, 3))\n- f(31203, 3) = 0 + 10*(f(3120, 3))\n- f(3120, 3) = 0 + 10*(f(312, 3))\n- f(312, 3) = 2 + 10*(f(31, 3))\n- f(31, 3) = 1 + 10*(f(3, 3))\n- f(3, 3) = f(0, 3) = 0\n- Working back: f(31, 3) = 1, f(312, 3) = 12, f(3120, 3) = 120, f(31203, 3) = 120, f(312032, 3) = 1202\n\nOption d: n=720721 and c=7\n- After removing all 7's: 20721\n- f(720721, 7) = 1 + 10*(f(72072, 7))\n- f(72072, 7) = 2 + 10*(f(7207, 7))\n- f(7207, 7) = 0 + 10*(f(720, 7))\n- f(720, 7) = 0 + 10*(f(72, 7))\n- f(72, 7) = 2 + 10*(f(7, 7))\n- f(7, 7) = f(0, 7) = 0\n- Working back: f(72, 7) = 2, f(720, 7) = 20, f(7207, 7) = 200, f(72072, 7) = 202, f(720721, 7) = 2021\n\nTherefore, option d is correct: n=720721 and c=7\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify the correct expression to access an element on the secondary diagonal of a 100×100 matrix.\n\n### Solution Approach\nIn a square matrix of size n×n:\n- The main diagonal has elements where row index = column index (i.e., m[i][i])\n- The secondary diagonal has elements where row index + column index = n-1 (i.e., m[i][n-1-i])\n\nFor a 100×100 matrix (indexed from 0 to 99), the secondary diagonal elements satisfy: row + column = 99\n\n### Answer\nOption d: m[42][57]\n\nLet's verify: 42 + 57 = 99, which confirms this element is on the secondary diagonal.\n\nOptions a, b, and c are all invalid syntax or don't represent elements on the secondary diagonal.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify a valid elementary cycle in a given undirected graph with 6 nodes and edges [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5], [5,6].\n\nAn elementary cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated vertices except for the start/end vertex.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's examine each option to see if it forms a valid elementary cycle:\n\na. 1,2,3 - This is a path, not a cycle (doesn't return to start)\nb. 1,2,3,1 - This is a cycle: 1→2→3→1\nc. 1,2,3,4,5,3,1 - This contains a repeated vertex (3) that is not the start/end\nd. 1,2,3,4,5,6,1 - This is not valid because there's no edge between 6 and 1\n\n### Answer\nOption b: 1,2,3,1\n\nThis forms a valid elementary cycle because:\n1. It starts and ends at the same vertex (1)\n2. No vertex is repeated except for the start/end vertex\n3. All edges in this path ([1,2], [2,3], [1,3]) exist in the graph\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the minimum number of nodes on level 3 of a tree with the following properties:\n1. All nodes on the same level have the same number of children\n2. No two different levels have the same number of nodes\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the number of children per node on level i as c_i.\n- Level 0: 1 node (the root)\n- Level 1: c_0 nodes\n- Level 2: c_0 * c_1 nodes\n- Level 3: c_0 * c_1 * c_2 nodes\n\nSince no two levels can have the same number of nodes, we need c_0 ≠ 1, c_0 ≠ c_0*c_1, and c_0*c_1 ≠ c_0*c_1*c_2.\n\nTo minimize the number of nodes on level 3, we need to find the smallest possible values for c_0, c_1, and c_2.\n\n### Answer\nOption c: 8\n\nHere's one possible configuration:\n- Level 0: 1 node (root)\n- Level 1: 2 nodes (c_0 = 2)\n- Level 2: 4 nodes (c_1 = 2)\n- Level 3: 8 nodes (c_2 = 2)\n\nThis satisfies our constraints:\n1. Each level has a different number of nodes (1, 2, 4, 8)\n2. All nodes on the same level have the same number of children\n3. 8 is the minimum possible number of nodes on level 3\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the given pseudocode algorithm, trace its execution for specific inputs, and perform other tasks related to the algorithm.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's first understand the algorithm:\n1. Read x and y\n2. If x > y, swap x and y\n3. Initialize nr = 1\n4. For each i from y down to x (decreasing by 1):\n   - Print 1\n   - If nr ≥ x, print 2\n   - Multiply nr by 3\n   - Print 1\n\n### Answer\n\na. For x=8 and y=5:\n   First, since x > y, we swap them, so x=5 and y=8.\n   nr = 1\n   \n   For i=8:\n   - Print 1\n   - Since nr=1 and x=5, nr < x, so nothing is printed\n   - nr = 1*3 = 3\n   - Print 1\n   \n   For i=7:\n   - Print 1\n   - Since nr=3 and x=5, nr < x, so nothing is printed\n   - nr = 3*3 = 9\n   - Print 1\n   \n   For i=6:\n   - Print 1\n   - Since nr=9 and x=5, nr ≥ x, so print 2\n   - nr = 9*3 = 27\n   - Print 1\n   \n   For i=5:\n   - Print 1\n   - Since nr=27 and x=5, nr ≥ x, so print 2\n   - nr = 27*3 = 81\n   - Print 1\n   \n   Output: 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nb. For x=10, we need to find two values of y such that the digit 2 is printed exactly three times.\n   \n   For the digit 2 to be printed, we need nr ≥ x (nr ≥ 10).\n   Starting with nr=1, after each iteration nr = nr*3.\n   \n   nr values: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, ...\n   \n   nr ≥ 10 happens starting from the 4th value (27), so we need y values that would give us exactly 3 iterations where nr ≥ 10.\n   \n   If y=12, we'll have iterations for i=12,11,10, and nr will be ≥10 for all three iterations.\n   If y=13, we'll have iterations for i=13,12,11,10, and nr will be ≥10 for the last three iterations.\n   \n   Two possible answers: y=12 and y=13\n\nc.

(cinteză, ciocârlie)\n2. (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă)\n3. (cinteză, ciocârlie, mierlă, scatiu)\n4. (cinteză, ciocârlie, privighetoare)\n\nWe need to find the two solutions immediately after (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu).\n\n### Answer\nBased on the pattern of the solutions, the backtracking algorithm is generating combinations in lexicographical order, with the constraint that \"mierlă\" and \"privighetoare\" cannot be in the same group.\n\nAfter (ciocârlie, privighetoare, scatiu), the next two solutions would be:\n1. (mierlă, privighetoare) - This is invalid due to the constraint\n2. (mierlă, scatiu)\n3. (mierlă, scatiu, privighetoare) - This is invalid due to the constraint\n\nSo the next two valid solutions are:\n- (mierlă, scatiu)\n- (privighetoare, scatiu)\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a structure named \"fractie\" with two integer fields: a (numerator) and b (denominator). We need to write code to compute fs = 2020/2021 - f.\n\n### Solution Approach\nTo subtract fractions, we need to:\n1. Find a common denominator\n2. Subtract the numerators\n3. Simplify the result if necessary\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n// Compute fs = 2020/2021 - f\nfs.b = 2021 * f.b; // Common denominator\nfs.a = 2020 * f.b - 2021 * f.a; // Numerator calculation\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function `divPrim` that calculates the sum of prime divisors of a number n that appear at an odd power in its prime factorization.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Iterate through potential prime factors from 2 to sqrt(n)\n2. For each prime factor, count how many times it divides n\n3. If the count is odd, add the prime to the sum\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\nvoid divPrim(long long n, int &s) {\n    s = 0;\n    \n    // Check if 2 is a divisor and count its power\n    int count = 0;\n    while (n % 2 == 0) {\n        count++;\n        n /= 2;\n    }\n    if (count % 2 == 1) {\n        s += 2;\n    }\n    \n    // Check odd numbers starting from 3\n    for (long long i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {\n        count = 0;\n        while (n % i == 0) {\n            count++;\n            n /= i;\n        }\n        if (count % 2 == 1) {\n            s += i;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if (n > 2) {\n        s += n;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a program that reads n words and outputs the first k words that end with a vowel. If there aren't k such words, it should output \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read n and k\n2. Read n words one by one\n3. Check if each word ends with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)\n4. Output the first k such words or \"nu exista\" if there aren't enough\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool endsWithVowel(const string& word) {\n    if (word.empty()) return false;\n    \n    char lastChar = word[word.length() - 1];\n    return (lastChar == 'a' || lastChar == 'e' || lastChar == 'i' || \n            lastChar == 'o' || lastChar == 'u');\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, k;\n    cin >> n >> k;\n    \n    int count = 0;\n    string word;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n && count < k; i++) {\n        cin >> word;\n        \n        if (endsWithVowel(word)) {\n            cout << word << endl;\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if (count < k) {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the last two consecutive terms in a sequence that have a given number x as their suffix. The algorithm should be efficient in terms of memory and execution time.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read x and the sequence from the file\n2. Keep track of the last two consecutive numbers that have x as a suffix\n3. To check if x is a suffix of a number y, we can:\n   - Convert y to string and check if it ends with x\n   - Or use arithmetic: x is a suffix of y if y % 10^(number of digits in x) == x\n\n### Answer\n\na. Algorithm description:\n1. Read x from the file\n2. Calculate the power of 10 needed (10^number of digits in x)\n3. Initialize variables to store the last two consecutive numbers with suffix x\n4. Read each number from the file one by one\n5. Check if the current number has x as a suffix\n6. If yes, update the last two consecutive numbers accordingly\n7. After processing all numbers, output the result\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n- It processes each number only once (O(n) time complexity)\n- It uses constant extra memory (O(1) space complexity)\n- It uses arithmetic operations to check for suffixes, which is faster than string manipulation\n\nb. C++ implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    \n    int x;\n    fin >> x;\n    \n    // Calculate 10^(number of digits in x)\n    int power = 1;\n    int temp = x;\n    while (temp > 0) {\n        power *= 10;\n        temp /= 10;\n    }\n    \n    long long current, prev = -1, prevPrev = -1;\n    int count = 0;\n    bool found = false;\n    \n    while (fin >> current) {\n        if (current % power == x) {\n            prevPrev = prev;\n            prev = current;\n            count++;\n            \n            if (count >= 2) {\n                found = true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    fin.close();\n    \n    if (found && prevPrev != -1) {\n        cout << prevPrev << \" \" << prev;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nu exista\";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```"
