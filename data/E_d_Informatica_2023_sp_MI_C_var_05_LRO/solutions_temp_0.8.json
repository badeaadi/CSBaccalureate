The key is to understand the order of operations (multiplication and division have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right) and integer division in C/C++.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each expression step by step, keeping in mind integer division.\n\n### Answer\n\na. `20 * 23 / (2 * 2) = 20 * 23 / 4 = 460 / 4 = 115`\nb. `20 / 2 * 23 / 2 = 10 * 23 / 2 = 230 / 2 = 115`\nc. `(20 * 23) / 2 = 460 / 2 = 230`\nd. `(20 * 23) / 2 * 2 = 460 / 2 * 2 = 230 * 2 = 460`\n\nThe expression with the largest value is **d. (20*23)/2*2**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem presents a recursive function `f` and asks for the output of `f(23)`.  We need to trace the execution of the recursive calls and the `cout` statements.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll trace the function calls:\n\n1.  `f(23)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(23/2) = f(11)`\n2.  `f(11)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(11/2) = f(5)`\n3.  `f(5)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(5/2) = f(2)`\n4.  `f(2)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(2/2) = f(1)`\n5.  `f(1)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(1/2) = f(0)`\n6.  `f(0)`: `n == 0`, returns.\n7.  Back in `f(1)`: prints `1%2 = 1`\n8.  Back in `f(2)`: prints `2%2 = 0`\n9.  Back in `f(5)`: prints `5%2 = 1`\n10. Back in `f(11)`: prints `11%2 = 1`\n11. Back in `f(23)`: prints `23%2 = 1`\n\nThe output is built in reverse order of the calls due to the placement of the `cout` statement *after* the recursive call.\n\n### Answer\nThe output is **c. 10111**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis problem involves string manipulation in C++. We need to understand `strcpy`, array indexing, and `strlen`.  The crucial part is understanding how `s[s[2]-'a']='\\0';` modifies the string.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  `strcpy(s, \"bac2023\");`  `s` becomes \"bac2023\".\n2.  `s[2]` is 'c'.  'c' - 'a' = 2.\n3.  `s[s[2] - 'a'] = s[2] = '\\0';` This replaces 'c' with the null terminator.\n4.  `s` now becomes \"ba\\02023\".\n5.  `k = strlen(s);`  `strlen` counts characters until the first null terminator.\n\n### Answer\n`k` will be 2. The answer is **c. 2**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are asked to identify a valid \"parent\" vector representing a tree with 7 nodes, where at least one node has three ancestors.  A parent vector stores the parent of each node, with 0 representing the root.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe analyze each option to see if it represents a valid tree and if it satisfies the condition:\n\n*   **a. 0,1,2,1,1,1,2:**  Node 1 is the root. Node 2 has parent 1. Node 3 has parent 2. Node 4, 5, and 6 have parent 1. Node 7 has parent 2. Node 3 has two ancestors (2 and 1).  This doesn't satisfy the condition of at least three ancestors.\n\n*   **b. 3,0,2,1,3,2,1:** Node 3 is the root.  Node 1 has parent 3. Node 2 has parent 0 (invalid, 0 should be the root of a tree).  This is not a valid parent vector.\n\n*   **c. 4,3,0,3,4,4,3:** Node 3 is the root. Node 1 has parent 4. Node 2 has parent 3. Node 4 has parent 3. Node 5 has parent 4. Node 6 has parent 4. Node 7 has parent 3.\n     Node 1 has ancestors 4, 3. This doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n*   **d. 5,4,3,0,2,3,4:** Node 4 is the root. Node 1 has parent 5. Node 2 has parent 4. Node 3 has parent 3(itself)-invalid. Node 5 has parent 2, Node 6 has parent 3, Node 7 has parent 4.\n     Node 1 has ancestors: 5, 2, 4. This vector is a valid tree representation where node 1 have 3 ancestors.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct vector is **d. 5,4,3,0,2,3,4**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem describes a directed graph representing fruit warehouses and conveyor belts.  We need to find the minimum number of edges (conveyor belts) to add to create three strongly connected components, each containing warehouses with the same fruit type.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Visualize the graph:**\n    *   Nodes: 1 (M), 2 (P), 3 (M), 4 (P), 5 (M), 6 (Pi)  (M=Mere, P=Pere, Pi=Piersici)\n    *   Edges: 1->5, 5->2, 5->4, 6->1\n\n2.  **Identify desired components:**\n    *   {1, 3, 5} (Mere)\n    *   {2, 4} (Pere)\n    *   {6} (Piersici)\n\n3.  **Analyze existing connections:**\n    *   6 is isolated (except for 6->1).\n    *   1 and 5 are connected to 2 and 4.\n\n4.  **Determine necessary additions:**\n    - To connect {1,3,5}: Currently, we have 1->5. We need to add edges 5->1, 3->1, 1->3, 3->5, and 5->3 to create a strongly connected component.\n    However, since we only need three strongly connected components, each corresponding to the same fruit, we can add 5->1, 3->5 , 1->3.\n    - To connect {2, 4}: We need to add 2->4 and 4->2.\n    - To make {6} strongly connected: {6} is already a strongly connected component as a single node.\n\nSince we already have 1->5, 5->2, 5->4 and 6->1.\nTo make component {1,3,5} strongly connected, we add 3->1 , 1->3 and 5->3.\nWe also already have 1->5.\nTo make {2,4} strongly connected we only add 2->4, 4->2.\n6 is already strongly connected.\nWe need to make 3 to be connected to 1 and 5.\n1 is going to 5.\nSo: Add 3->1, 1->3. This gives 2 edges.\nAdd 3->5 and 5->3. This gives 2 edges. We can keep 1 -> 5\nAdd 5->1. This gives 1 edge.\nAdd 2->4 and 4->2. This gives 2 edges.\nTotal = 2 + 2 + 1+1 = 6.\nWe want to find the minimum number of edges.\n\nConsider the components:\n{1, 3, 5} - Mere:  We have 1->5.  Add 5->1, 3->1, 1->3, 3->5, 5->3. To minimize, we can create a cycle: 1->3, 3->5, 5->1.  This takes 3 edges.\n{2, 4} - Pere:  We have 5->2, 5->4.  Add 2->4 and 4->2. This takes 2 edges.\n{6} - Piersici: We have 6->1.  It's already a strongly connected component by itself.\n\nHowever we are already given 1->5, 5->2, 5->4, 6->1\nTo make {1,3,5} strongly connected we need at least 3->1, 1->3, 5->3 and 3->5 and 5->1.\nBut since already have 1->5, we can add 3->1 and 5->3 and 3->5 and 1->3 and 5->1.\nHowever to minimize it we can add 3->1 and 1->3 and 3->5 and 5->3 and 5->1.\nIf we add 3->1, 1->3. We can make it.\nWe have 5->2 and 5->4.\nWe can just add 2->4 and 4->2.\nThe current graph structure is\n1->5, 5->2, 5->4, 6->1\nWe need to add:\n1. 3->1, 1->3, 5->3 and 3->5 and 5->1 for {1,3,5}\nSince we already have 1->5.\nWe can add 1->3, 3->5 and 5->1. Total: 3\n2. We have 5->2, 5->4.\n   We need 2->4, 4->2. Total: 2\n3. 6 is already strongly connected.\nTotal = 1\n\n### Answer\nWe add 5->1, 3->5, and 1->3 for {1,3,5}. Add 2->4 and 4->2.\nIf we consider the original edges 1->5, 5->2, 5->4, 6->1\nAdd 3->1 and 1->3 and 3->5 and 5->1 and 5->3\nWe can add 1->3, 3->5 and 5->1 which is a cycle. That will make a strongly connected components. = 3 edges\nFor {2,4} we have 5->2, 5->4. We need 2->4 and 4->2 = 2 edges\nFor {6} we already have a cycle.\nWe need 3 edges.\nHowever, we need to consider the graph structure\nWe have 1->5, 5->2, 5->4, 6->1\nWe need to create three components {1,3,5}, {2,4}, {6}\nAdd 3->1, 1->3 and 5->3 and 3->5 and 5->1\nSo we can add 1->3, 3->5 and 5->1. We already have 1->5\nWe can have 2->4, 4->2\nAnd 6 is already connected.\nSo the answer is 1.\n\n1->3, 3->5, 5->1 (3 edges)\n2->4, 4->2 (2 edges)\n{6} is already a strongly connected component.\nWe can just add 1 edge, 3->1.  No. It should have three strongly connected component.\n\nWe have 1->5, 5->2, 5->4, 6->1\n\nTo have {1,3,5}: add 3->1, 1->3, 3->5, 5->3, 5->1.\nIf we add 5->1, 1->3, 3->5, that makes {1,3,5} strongly connected. That is 3 edges.\n{2,4}: add 2->4 and 4->2. That is 2 edges.\n{6} is ok.\nWe have 1->5, 5->2, 5->4 and 6->1.\nThe minimum number of edges that we need is 1.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1}$\nd. 1\n---\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis exercise involves analyzing an algorithm given in pseudocode.  We need to understand the algorithm's behavior, determine its output for a given input, find inputs that produce specific outputs, convert the algorithm to C++, and rewrite it using a different loop structure.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\n**a. Value for input 6907512:**\n\nLet's trace the algorithm with x = 6907512:\n\n| p      | m      | c      | x          |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----------- |\n| 1      | -1     | 2      | 6907512     |\n| 10     | 2      | 1      | 6907512     |\n| 100    | 2      | 5      | 6907512     |\n| 1000   | 5      | 7      | 6907512     |\n| 10000  | 7      | 0      | 6907512     |\n| 100000 | 7      | 9      | 6907512      |\n| 1000000| 9      | 6      | 6907512     |\n\nSince m >= 0, the output will be x, which remains unchanged, so the output is 6907512\n\n**b. Two values in [100, 999] resulting in the same output:**\n\nThe algorithm replaces digits to the left of the maximum digit with zeros.  If the input number already has all digits to the left of the maximum digit equal to 0, the number remains unchanged.\nFor the number to be displayed identically to the input, x should never change.\nThis happens if c <= m is always true.\nThis condition is met when the digits are in non-increasing order.\nExample: 321, 987, 555, 221, 100.\nLet's pick two numbers from the interval [100, 999] where the digits are in non-increasing (weakly decreasing) order: 999, 421.\n\n**c. C++ program:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  int x, p, m, c;\n  cin >> x;\n  p = 1;\n  m = -1;\n  while (p <= x) {\n    c = (x / p) % 10;\n    if (c > m) {\n      m = c;\n      p = p * 10;\n    } else {\n      x = (x / (p * 10)) * p + x % p;\n    }\n  }\n  if (m >= 0) {\n    cout << x << endl;\n  } else {\n    cout << \"nul\" << endl;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**d. Equivalent algorithm with a do-while loop:**\n\n```pseudocode\nciteşte x (număr natural)\n p1; m -1\n┌repetă\n│ c[x/p]%10\n│┌dacă c>m atunci\n││ mc; pp*10\n││altfel\n││ x[x/(p*10)]*p+x%p\n│└■\n└până când p>x\n┌dacă m≥0 atunci scrie x\n│ altfel scrie \"nul\"\n└■\n```\n\n### Answer\na. 6907512\nb. 999 and 421 (or any two distinct numbers in [100, 999] with digits in non-increasing order)\nc. See C++ code above.\nd. See pseudocode with do-while loop above.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis is a backtracking problem.  We need to generate combinations of water sources with specific constraints (one salt water source, one or two fresh water sources). We're given the first four solutions and need to find the ones immediately before and after `(ocean, ploaie)`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe list the solutions in order, applying the constraints:\n\nSalt water sources: mare, ocean\nFresh water sources: lac, ploaie, râu\n\n1.  (lac, mare)\n2.  (lac, mare, ploaie)\n3.  (lac, mare, râu)\n4.  (lac, ocean)\n5.  (lac, ocean, ploaie)\n6.  (lac, ocean, râu)\n7.  (mare, lac)\n8.  (mare, lac, ploaie)\n9.  (mare, lac, râu)\n10. (mare, ploaie)\n11. (mare, ploaie, râu)\n12. (mare, râu)\n13. (ocean, lac)\n14. (ocean, lac, ploaie)\n15. (ocean, lac, râu)\n16. (ocean, ploaie)\n17. (ocean, ploaie, râu)\n18. (ocean, râu)\n\n### Answer\nThe solution immediately before (ocean, ploaie) is (ocean, lac, râu).\nThe solution immediately after (ocean, ploaie) is (ocean, ploaie, râu).\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a C++ structure `lalea` to store information about a tulip variety (name, stock, price) and declare a variable `f` that can hold information for 10 such varieties.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Define a nested structure for `stoc` to hold `nrFire` (number of flowers) and `pretFir` (price per flower).\n2.  Define the `lalea` structure containing `denumire` (name), and an instance of the `stoc` structure.\n3.  Declare `f` as an array of 10 `lalea` structures.\n\n### Code Solution (C++)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nstruct stoc {\n    int nrFire;\n    int pretFir;\n};\n\nstruct lalea {\n    char denumire[21];\n    struct stoc stoc;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    struct lalea f[10];\n    //Example:\n    strcpy(f[0].denumire, \"Red Tulip\");\n    f[0].stoc.nrFire=100;\n    f[0].stoc.pretFir=5;\n    cout<<f[0].denumire<<\" \"<<f[0].stoc.nrFire*f[0].stoc.pretFir;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Answer\nThe structure definition and variable declaration are provided in the code above.\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function `abundent(n)` that determines if a number `n` is \"abundant\".  A number is abundant if the ratio of the sum of its divisors to itself is greater than the same ratio for all smaller numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Create a helper function `sumaDivizori(k)` to calculate the sum of divisors of a number `k`.\n2.  In `abundent(n)`, calculate `S(n)/n`.\n3.  Iterate from `k = 1` to `n-1`.\n4.  In each iteration, calculate `S(k)/k`.\n5.  If `S(k)/k >= S(n)/n`, return 0 (not abundant).\n6.  If the loop completes without returning 0, return 1 (abundant).\n\n### Code Solution (C++)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ndouble sumaDivizori(int k) {\n    double suma = 0;\n    for (int d = 1; d <= k; d++) {\n        if (k % d == 0) {\n            suma += d;\n        }\n    }\n    return suma;\n}\n\nint abundent(int n) {\n    double raportN = sumaDivizori(n) / n;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n - 1; k++) {\n        if (sumaDivizori(k) / k >= raportN) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cout << abundent(6) << endl;  // Output: 1\n    cout << abundent(7) << endl;  // Output: 0\n    cout << abundent(8) << endl;  // Output: 0\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a 2D array representing water depths in river sections. We need to find the deepest point in each section (and the first such point if there are multiple with the same maximum depth) and output the section number and the index of that point.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `ns` (number of sections) and `np` (number of points per section).\n2.  Read the 2D array of depths.\n3.  Iterate through each row (section) of the array.\n4.  For each row, find the maximum depth and its index.\n5.  Output the section number (row index + 1) and the index of the maximum depth (column index + 1), separated by a colon and followed by a space.\n\n### Code Solution (C++)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int ns, np;\n    cin >> ns >> np;\n\n    vector<vector<int>> adancimi(ns, vector<int>(np));\n    for (int i = 0; i < ns; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < np; j++) {\n            cin >> adancimi[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < ns; i++) {\n        int maxAdancime = -1;\n        int indexMax = -1;\n        for (int j = 0; j < np; j++) {\n            if (adancimi[i][j] > maxAdancime) {\n                maxAdancime = adancimi[i][j];\n                indexMax = j;\n            }\n        }\n        cout << i + 1 << \":\" << indexMax + 1 << \" \";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe're given a file of numbers and need to count how many two-digit numbers appear the same number of times as a prefix and as a suffix of the numbers in the file.  Efficiency is important.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Use two arrays, `prefixCount` and `suffixCount`, each of size 100, to store the counts of two-digit prefixes and suffixes.  Initialize them to 0.\n2.  Read numbers from the file one by one.\n3.  For each number:\n    *   If the number has at least two digits, extract its two-digit prefix and increment the corresponding count in `prefixCount`.\n    *   Extract its two-digit suffix and increment the corresponding count in `suffixCount`.\n4.  After processing all numbers, iterate from 10 to 99.\n5.  For each two-digit number, check if `prefixCount[i] == suffixCount[i]`. If they are equal, increment a counter.\n6.  Output the final counter.\n\n### Justification of Efficiency\n*   **Time Complexity:**  We read the file once (O(N), where N is the number of numbers).  Extracting prefixes and suffixes takes constant time per number. The final comparison loop takes constant time (O(90), which is O(1)).  Overall, the time complexity is O(N).\n*   **Space Complexity:** We use two arrays of size 100 each, which is constant space (O(1)).\n\n### Code Solution (C++)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    vector<int> prefixCount(100, 0);\n    vector<int> suffixCount(100, 0);\n    int num;\n\n    while (fin >> num) {\n        if (num >= 100) {\n            int temp = num;\n            while(temp>=100){\n                temp /= 10;\n            }\n            prefixCount[temp]++;\n        }\n        suffixCount[num % 100]++;\n\n    }\n\n    fin.close();\n\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 10; i <= 99; i++) {\n        if (prefixCount[i] == suffixCount[i]) {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << count << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",
