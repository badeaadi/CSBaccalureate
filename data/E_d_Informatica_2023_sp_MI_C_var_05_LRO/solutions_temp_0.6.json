    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.6": "Okay, here are the solutions for each exercise, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks to compare the results of four different C/C++ expressions involving integer arithmetic and determine which one yields the largest value.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will evaluate each expression, paying close attention to the order of operations and integer division.\n\n### Answer\nLet's evaluate each expression:\n\na. `20 * 23 / (2 * 2)` = `20 * 23 / 4` = `460 / 4` = `115`\nb. `20 / 2 * 23 / 2` = `10 * 23 / 2` = `230 / 2` = `115`\nc. `(20 * 23) / 2` = `460 / 2` = `230`\nd. `(20 * 23) / 2 * 2` = `460 / 2 * 2` = `230 * 2` = `460`\n\nThe largest value is 460, corresponding to expression d.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem presents a recursive function `f` and asks for the output when called with the argument 23. We need to trace the execution of the recursive calls and the `cout` statements.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll trace the function calls:\n\n1.  `f(23)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(23/2)`, i.e., `f(11)`\n2.  `f(11)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(11/2)`, i.e., `f(5)`\n3.  `f(5)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(5/2)`, i.e., `f(2)`\n4.  `f(2)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(2/2)`, i.e., `f(1)`\n5.  `f(1)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(1/2)`, i.e., `f(0)`\n6.  `f(0)`: `n == 0`, returns.\n7.  Back in `f(1)`: prints `1 % 2`, which is `1`\n8.  Back in `f(2)`: prints `2 % 2`, which is `0`\n9.  Back in `f(5)`: prints `5 % 2`, which is `1`\n10. Back in `f(11)`: prints `11 % 2`, which is `1`\n11. Back in `f(23)`: prints `23 % 2`, which is `1`\n\nThe output is the concatenation of these printed values: 10111.\n\n### Answer\nThe output is 10111 (option c).\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem involves string manipulation in C. We need to understand how `strcpy`, array indexing with characters, and `strlen` work to determine the final value of `k`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  `strcpy(s, \"bac2023\");`: `s` becomes \"bac2023\".\n2.  `s[s[2] - 'a'] = '\\0';`:\n    *   `s[2]` is 'c'.\n    *   `'c' - 'a'` is 2 (ASCII difference).\n    *   `s[2] = '\\0';`:  `s` becomes \"ba\\02023\".  The null terminator is placed at index 2.\n3.  `k = strlen(s);`: `strlen` counts characters until the first null terminator.\n\n### Answer\n`k` will be 2 (option c).\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find a valid \"parent\" vector (vector de tați) for a tree with 7 nodes, where at least one node has three ancestors.  A parent vector stores the parent of each node, with 0 indicating the root.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n*   a. `0,1,2,1,1,1,2`: Node 3 has parent 2, node 2 has parent 1, node 1 has parent 0 (root). Node 3 has 2 ancestors. No node has three ancestors.\n*   b. `3,0,2,1,3,2,1`: Node 7 has parent 1, node 1 has parent 3, node 3 has parent 0. So, node 7 has 2 ancestors.\n*  c. `4,3,0,3,4,4,3`: Node 7's parent is 3, 3's parent is 0. Node 7 has two ancestors.\n*   d. `5,4,3,0,2,3,4`: Node 6 has parent 4, node 4 has parent 2, node 2 has parent 3, node 3 has parent 0. Node 6 has three ancestors (4, 2, and 3).\n\n### Answer\nOption d is the correct answer.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem describes a directed graph representing fruit transport between depots.  We need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to create three strongly connected components, each containing depots with the same type of fruit.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe initial graph has the following edges:\n1 -> 5\n5 -> 2\n5 -> 4\n6 -> 1\n\nThe desired strongly connected components are:\n{1, 3, 5} (apples)\n{2, 4} (pears)\n{6} (peaches)\n\nCurrently:\n- 6 is isolated.\n- 1, 5, 2, and 4 form a cycle, but 3 is not connected.\n\nTo achieve the desired components:\n\n1.  **{6}:**  This component is already strongly connected.\n2.  **{2, 4}:** We have 5->2 and 5->4.  We need to connect 2 and 4 to each other to make them strongly connected.  Adding 2->4 and 4->2 would work, but 4->2 is not necessary because 2 is already reachable from 4 via 2->5. Adding 2->4 completes this component and 4->2 is not necessary.\n3.  **{1, 3, 5}:**  We have 1->5. We need to connect 3 to the cycle.  Adding 3->1 and 5->1 and 1->3 is redundant.\nWe need to add 5->1, and 3->1 and 1->3 is redundant.\nAdding 3 to the existing (1,5,2,4) cycle, we need to add 3->1 and 5->3 and 1->3 is redundant.\n\nWe have 1->5, 5->2, 5->4, and 6->1.\nWe need to create: {1, 5, 3}, {2, 4}, {6}.\nAdd 5 -> 3, 3 -> 1 (to connect 3). This gives {1, 5, 3, 2, 4} and {6}\nAdd 2 ->4.\nWe need to create 3 strongly connected components.\nWe add: 3->1, 5->3. This gives a strongly connected component {1,3,5}\nWe have 5->2 and 5->4. We add 2->4. This gives a strong connected component {2,4,5}\nWe have 6->1.\n{1,3,5}\n{2,4}\n{6}\nWe need to add 3->1, 5->3 and 2->4\n\n### Answer\nWe need to add 3 edges: 3 -> 1, 5 -> 3 and 2->4 (Option b).\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this problem)\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm processes a number `x` digit by digit. It finds the largest digit (`m`) and, based on whether a larger digit is found, modifies `x` by removing digits.\n\n### Solution Approach\na. We'll trace the algorithm with `x = 6907512`.\n\n| p     | c     | m     | x         |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :-------- |\n| 1     | 2     | 2     | 6907512   |\n| 10    | 1     | 2     | 6907502   |\n| 10    | 5     | 5     | 690702    |\n| 100   | 7     | 7     | 690002    |\n| 1000  | 0     | 7     | 690002     |\n| 1000  | 9     | 9     | 600002    |\n| 10000 | 6   | 9    | 2 |\n|10000| 0 | 9 | 2 |\n| 100000| -| 9 | 2|\n\nThe algorithm prints the final value of x, which is 2\n\nb.  We need two numbers in the range [100, 999] that remain unchanged after the algorithm's execution.  This happens when the digits are in non-decreasing order from left to right.  For example, 123 and 444.\n\nc. C++ Code implementation.\n\nd. Equivalent algorithm using a \"repeat...until\" (do...while) structure.\n\n### Answer\na. 2\nb. 123 and 444 (any two distinct numbers with non-decreasing digits from 100-999)\n\n### Code Solution (c)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, p, m, c;\n    cin >> x;\n    p = 1;\n    m = -1;\n    while (p <= x) {\n        c = (x / p) % 10;\n        if (c > m) {\n            m = c;\n            p = p * 10;\n        } else {\n            x = (x / (p * 10)) * p + x % p;\n        }\n    }\n    if (m >= 0) {\n        cout << x << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nul\" << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Pseudocode Solution (d)\n```\nciteşte x (număr natural)\n p1; m -1\n┌repetă\n│ c[x/p]%10\n│┌dacă c>m atunci\n││ mc; pp*10\n││altfel\n││ x[x/(p*10)]*p+x%p\n│└■\n└până când p>x\n┌dacă m≥0 atunci scrie x\n│ altfel scrie \"nul\"\n└■\n```\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis problem involves generating combinations using backtracking.  We need to identify the combinations immediately before and after a given combination, considering the constraints on saltwater and freshwater sources.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe sources are {lac, mare, ocean, ploaie, râu}.  Saltwater sources are {mare, ocean}, and freshwater sources are {lac, ploaie, râu}.  The rules are: exactly one saltwater source and one or two freshwater sources.\n\nThe given sequence is:\n1.  (lac, mare)\n2.  (lac, mare, ploaie)\n3.  (lac, mare, râu)\n4.  (lac, ocean)\n...\nTarget: (ocean, ploaie)\n\nLet's list out the combinations in order:\n\n(lac, mare)\n(lac, mare, ploaie)\n(lac, mare, râu)\n(lac, ocean)\n(lac, ocean, ploaie)\n(lac, ocean, râu)\n(mare, lac)\n(mare, lac, ploaie)\n(mare, lac, râu)\n(mare, ploaie)\n(mare, ploaie, râu)\n(mare, râu)\n(ocean, lac)\n(ocean, lac, ploaie)\n(ocean, lac, râu)\n(ocean, ploaie)\n(ocean, ploaie, râu)\n(ocean, râu)\n\n### Answer\nThe solution generated immediately before (ocean, ploaie) is (ocean, lac, râu).\nThe solution generated immediately after (ocean, ploaie) is (ocean, ploaie, râu).\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a C++ structure named `lalea` to store information about a tulip variety, including its name, stock (number of flowers), and price per flower.  We are given example expressions to access specific members.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe structure needs a string for the name and a nested structure for stock-related information.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nstruct stoc {\n    int nrFire;\n    int pretFir;\n};\n\nstruct lalea {\n    char denumire[21];\n    struct stoc stoc;\n};\n\nlalea f[10];\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nDefine a function `abundent(n)` that returns 1 if `n` is an abundant number and 0 otherwise.  An abundant number has the property that S(n)/n > S(k)/k for all k < n, where S(i) is the sum of divisors of i.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Create a helper function `sumaDivizori(int x)` to calculate the sum of divisors of a number `x`.\n2.  In `abundent(n)`, calculate `S(n)/n`.\n3.  Iterate through numbers `k` from 1 to `n-1`.\n4.  For each `k`, calculate `S(k)/k`.\n5.  If `S(k)/k >= S(n)/n`, return 0.\n6.  If the loop completes without returning 0, return 1.\n\n### Answer\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ndouble sumaDivizori(int x) {\n    double suma = 0;\n    for (int d = 1; d <= x; d++) {\n        if (x % d == 0) {\n            suma += d;\n        }\n    }\n    return suma;\n}\n\nint abundent(int n) {\n    double raportN = sumaDivizori(n) / n;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n - 1; k++) {\n        if (sumaDivizori(k) / k >= raportN) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cout << abundent(6) << endl; // Output: 1\n    cout << abundent(7) << endl; // Output: 0\n    cout << abundent(8) << endl; // Output: 0\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nGiven a 2D array representing water depths in river sections, find the deepest point in each section and output the section number and the index of that point. If multiple points have the same maximum depth, choose the first one.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read `ns` (number of sections) and `np` (number of points per section).\n2.  Read the 2D array.\n3.  Iterate through each row (section) of the array.\n4.  For each row, find the maximum depth and its index.\n5.  Output the section number and the index of the maximum depth, separated by a colon and followed by a space.\n\n### Answer\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int ns, np;\n    cin >> ns >> np;\n\n    vector<vector<int>> adancimi(ns, vector<int>(np));\n    for (int i = 0; i < ns; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < np; j++) {\n            cin >> adancimi[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < ns; i++) {\n        int maxAdancime = -1;\n        int indexMax = -1;\n        for (int j = 0; j < np; j++) {\n            if (adancimi[i][j] > maxAdancime) {\n                maxAdancime = adancimi[i][j];\n                indexMax = j + 1;\n            }\n        }\n        cout << i + 1 << \":\" << indexMax << \" \";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nRead numbers from a file and count how many two-digit numbers appear the same number of times as prefixes and suffixes of the numbers in the file.  The algorithm should be efficient.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Use two arrays, `prefixCount` and `suffixCount`, each of size 100, to store the counts of two-digit prefixes and suffixes. Initialize them to 0.\n2.  Read numbers from the file one by one.\n3.  For each number:\n    *   If the number has at least two digits, extract the first two digits to get the prefix and increment the corresponding `prefixCount` element.\n    *   Extract the last two digits to get the suffix and increment the corresponding `suffixCount` element.\n4.  After processing all numbers, iterate through the `prefixCount` and `suffixCount` arrays.\n5.  Count how many times `prefixCount[i]` equals `suffixCount[i]` for `i` from 10 to 99.\n6.  Output this count.\n\n### Answer\na. The algorithm uses two arrays to store the frequency of two-digit prefixes and suffixes. This avoids nested loops and repeated calculations, resulting in an O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of numbers in the file. It reads each number once, extracts the prefix and suffix (constant time operations), and updates the counts. The final comparison of the two arrays also takes constant time (O(100), which is O(1)). This is efficient in terms of time.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    vector<int> prefixCount(100, 0);\n    vector<int> suffixCount(100, 0);\n    int num;\n\n    while (fin >> num) {\n        if (num >= 10) {\n            int temp = num;\n            while (temp >= 100) {\n                temp /= 10;\n            }\n            if(temp>=10)\n                prefixCount[temp]++;\n\n            suffixCount[num % 100]++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 10; i < 100; i++) {\n        if (prefixCount[i] == suffixCount[i]) {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << count << endl;\n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

(20*23)/2 = 460/2 = 230\nd. (20*23)/2*2 = 460/2*2 = 230*2 = 460\n\n### Answer\nThe expression with the highest value is d. (20*23)/2*2 = 460\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to trace the recursive function f(23) and determine what it outputs. The function converts a decimal number to its binary representation.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's trace the execution of f(23):\n1. n=23, 23!=0, so call f(23/2) = f(11)\n2. n=11, 11!=0, so call f(11/2) = f(5)\n3. n=5, 5!=0, so call f(5/2) = f(2)\n4. n=2, 2!=0, so call f(2/2) = f(1)\n5. n=1, 1!=0, so call f(1/2) = f(0)\n6. n=0, 0==0, so return to previous call\n7.

Print 23%2 = 1\n\n### Answer\nThe output is 10111, which corresponds to option c. 010111 (the leading 0 is shown in the option but doesn't affect the value).\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the value of k after executing the given code sequence. This involves string manipulation and finding the length of a string after modification.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. We start with s = \"bac2023\"\n2. s[s[2]-'a'] is s['c'-'a'] = s[2] (since 'c'-'a' = 2)\n3. So we set s[2] = '\\0', making s = \"ba\"\n4.

We need to check each option to see which one contains such a node.\n\nFor option c: 4,3,0,3,4,4,3\n- Node 1 has father 4\n- Node 2 has father 3\n- Node 3 has father 0 (root)\n- Node 4 has father 3\n- Node 5 has father 4\n- Node 6 has father 4\n- Node 7 has father 3\n\nLet's trace the ancestors of node 1:\n- Father of 1 is 4\n- Father of 4 is 3\n- Father of 3 is 0 (root)\n\nNode 1 has 3 ancestors, which meets our requirement.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is c. 4,3,0,3,4,4,3\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a directed graph representing storage facilities and transport belts. We need to add the minimum number of transport belts to create three strongly connected components, each containing facilities with the same type of fruit.\n\n### Solution Approach\nCurrent arcs: 1→5, 5→2, 5→4, 6→1\n\nWe need three strongly connected components:\n1. Apples: nodes 1, 3, 5\n2. Pears: nodes 2, 4\n3. Peaches: node 6\n\nFor each component to be strongly connected:\n- For apples (1,3,5): We have 1→5, but need 5→3, 3→1\n- For pears (2,4): We have 5→2, 5→4, but need 2→4, 4→2\n- For peaches (6): Already strongly connected (single node)\n\n### Answer\nWe need to add 4 arcs: 5→3, 3→1, 2→4, 4→2.

A number n is abundant if S(n)/n > S(k)/k for all k < n, where S(i) is the sum of all positive divisors of i.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Calculate S(n)/n\n2. For each k from 1 to n-1, calculate S(k)/k\n3. If any S(k)/k ≥ S(n)/n, return 0\n4. Otherwise, return 1\n\nTo optimize, we'll calculate the sum of divisors efficiently.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\nint abundent(int n) {\n    // Calculate S(n) - sum of divisors of n\n    long long Sn = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        if (n % i == 0) {\n            Sn += i;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Calculate ratio for n\n    double ratioN = (double)Sn / n;\n    \n    // Check all numbers from 1 to n-1\n    for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {\n        long long Sk = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n            if (k % i == 0) {\n                Sk += i;\n            }\n        }\n        double ratioK = (double)Sk / k;\n        \n        // If any ratio is greater or equal, n is not abundant\n        if (ratioK >= ratioN) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return 1;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to identify the deepest point in each section of a river and output the section number and point number for each section.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor each section (row in the matrix):\n1. Find the maximum depth value\n2. Find the first occurrence of this maximum value\n3. Output the section number and the point number\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int ns, np;\n    cin >> ns >> np;\n    \n    int adancime[1000][50];\n    \n    // Read the depths\n    for (int i = 0; i < ns; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < np; j++) {\n            cin >> adancime[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Process each section\n    for (int i = 0; i < ns; i++) {\n        int maxAdancime = -1;\n        int punctMaxim = -1;\n        \n        // Find the maximum depth and its first occurrence\n        for (int j = 0; j < np; j++) {\n            if (adancime[i][j] > maxAdancime) {\n                maxAdancime = adancime[i][j];\n                punctMaxim = j;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        // Output the section number and point number (1-indexed)\n        cout << (i + 1) << \":\" << (punctMaxim + 1) << \" \";\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to count how many two-digit numbers appear the same number of times as prefixes and suffixes in the numbers from the input file.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read all numbers from the file\n2. Count how many times each two-digit number appears as a prefix and as a suffix\n3. Count how many two-digit numbers have the same prefix and suffix count\n\nTo optimize:\n- We'll use arrays to keep track of prefix and suffix counts\n- We only need to process each number once\n\n### Algorithm Description\n1. Initialize two arrays prefixCount and suffixCount to store counts for all two-digit numbers (10-99)\n2. For each number in the file:\n   - Extract its first two digits as a prefix (if it has at least two digits)\n   - Extract its last two digits as a suffix (if it has at least two digits)\n   - Increment the corresponding counts in the arrays\n3. Count how many two-digit numbers have the same value in both arrays\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n- It processes each number only once\n- It uses O(1) extra space (fixed-size arrays)\n- It has O(N) time complexity where N is the number of numbers in the file\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    \n    int prefixCount[100] = {0}; // Counts for two-digit numbers as prefixes\n    int suffixCount[100] = {0}; // Counts for two-digit numbers as suffixes\n    \n    int num;\n    while (fin >> num) {\n        // Get the number of digits\n        int temp = num;\n        int digits = 0;\n        while (temp > 0) {\n            temp /= 10;\n            digits++;\n        }\n        \n        // Process only if number has at least 2 digits\n        if (digits >= 2) {\n            // Get last two digits (suffix)\n            int suffix = num % 100;\n            if (suffix >= 10) {\n                suffixCount[suffix]++;\n            }\n            \n            // Get first two digits (prefix)\n            int prefix = num;\n            while (prefix >= 100) {\n                prefix /= 10;\n            }\n            if (prefix >= 10) {\n                prefixCount[prefix]++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Count numbers with equal prefix and suffix counts\n    int result = 0;\n    for (int i = 10; i <= 99; i++) {\n        if (prefixCount[i] == suffixCount[i] && prefixCount[i] > 0) {\n            result++;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    cout << result;\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```",

For `f(23)`, the binary representation is `10111`, but printed in reverse order, it will be `11101`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct output is b. 111010.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe variable `s` is a string, and we manipulate it by setting a specific character to `\\0` based on its ASCII value. Then, we calculate the length of the modified string.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. `strcpy(s, \"bac2023\");` initializes `s` to \"bac2023\".\n2. `s[s[2]-'a']='\\0';` modifies the string: `s[2]` is 'c', ASCII value 99, so `s[99 - 97]` becomes '\\0', modifying the string to \"bac\".\n3. `k=strlen(s);` calculates the length of \"bac\", which is 3.\n\n### Answer\nThe value of `k` is 3, which is not listed, indicating a potential error in the problem setup.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find a \"parent vector\" for a tree structure that has at least one node with three ascendants.\n\n### Solution Approach\nAnalyze each option to see if any node has three parents:\n- a. 0,1,2,1,1,1,2\n- b. 3,0,2,1,3,2,1\n- c. 4,3,0,3,4,4,3\n- d. 5,4,3,0,2,3,4\n\nNone of the options seem to represent a valid tree structure with one node having three ascendants. This requires reevaluation as none satisfy the condition directly.\n\n### Answer\nReevaluation suggests there might be a mistake in understanding the problem. More context is needed.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to add transport lanes to ensure that the graph has three strongly connected components, each corresponding to the type of fruit.\n\n### Solution Approach\nCurrent setup:\n- Depots containing the same type of fruit must be connected directly or indirectly.\n- Connect depot 1 to depot 3, depot 3 to depot 5 (all apples).\n- Connect depot 2 to depot 4 (all pears).\n- Depot 6 is isolated, containing peaches.\n\n### Answer\nWe need to add 2 transport lanes: 1->3 and 2->4.
