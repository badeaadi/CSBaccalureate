    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.4": "Okay, here are the solutions for each exercise, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks to compare the values of four C/C++ expressions involving integer multiplication and division and determine which one has the largest value.  The key here is to understand the order of operations and the effect of integer division.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Evaluate each expression, keeping in mind that C++ performs integer division (truncates the decimal part).\n2. Compare the results.\n\n### Answer\nLet's evaluate:\n\na. `20 * 23 / (2 * 2) = 460 / 4 = 115`\nb. `20 / 2 * 23 / 2 = 10 * 23 / 2 = 230 / 2 = 115`\nc. `(20 * 23) / 2 = 460 / 2 = 230`\nd. `(20 * 23) / 2 * 2 = 460 / 2 * 2 = 230 * 2 = 460`\n\nThe largest value is 460.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **d. (20*23)/2*2**\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem presents a recursive function `f` and asks for the output when called with the argument 23. We need to trace the execution of the recursive calls and the `cout` statements.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Trace the recursive calls, noting the value of `n` at each step.\n2. Since the `cout` statement comes *after* the recursive call, the output will be generated in reverse order of the remainders.\n\n### Answer\nLet's trace the calls:\n\n1. `f(23)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(23/2) = f(11)`\n2. `f(11)`: `n != 0`, calls `f(11/2) = f(5)`\n3. `f(5)`:  `n != 0`, calls `f(5/2) = f(2)`\n4. `f(2)`:  `n != 0`, calls `f(2/2) = f(1)`\n5. `f(1)`:  `n != 0`, calls `f(1/2) = f(0)`\n6. `f(0)`:  `n == 0`, base case, returns.\n7. Back in `f(1)`: prints `1 % 2 = 1`\n8. Back in `f(2)`: prints `2 % 2 = 0`\n9. Back in `f(5)`: prints `5 % 2 = 1`\n10. Back in `f(11)`: prints `11 % 2 = 1`\n11. Back in `f(23)`: prints `23 % 2 = 1`\n\nThe output is 10111.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **c. 010111** is incorrect, the correct answer is 10111, which is not in the options, but is the correct result.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis problem involves string manipulation in C++. We need to understand how `strcpy`, `strlen`, and character arithmetic work to determine the final value of `k`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Analyze the `strcpy` statement to see the initial string.\n2. Analyze the modification `s[s[2]-'a']='\\0';` to understand which character is replaced by the null terminator.\n3. Calculate the string length using `strlen`.\n\n### Answer\n1. `strcpy(s, \"bac2023\");`  `s` becomes \"bac2023\".\n2. `s[2]` is 'c'.  'c' - 'a' = 2.  So, `s[2] = '\\0';`  `s` becomes \"ba\\02023\".\n3. `k = strlen(s);` `strlen` counts characters until the first null terminator.\n\nTherefore, `k` will be 2.\n\nThe answer is **c. 2**\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given four arrays and asked to identify which one represents a valid \"parent\" vector (vector de tați) for a tree with 7 nodes, where at least one node has three ancestors.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Recall that in a parent vector, `t[i]` represents the parent of node `i`.  The root node has a parent of 0.\n2.  A node has three ancestors if we can follow the parent links three times back to the root.\n3. Check each vector for validity (no cycles, single root) and the three-ancestor condition.\n\n### Answer\nLet's analyze each option:\n\na. `0,1,2,1,1,1,2`: Node 6 has parent 2, parent 1, parent 0 (three ancestors). This is a valid tree.\nb. `3,0,2,1,3,2,1`: Node 0 has parent 3, but this is not a valid tree.\nc. `4,3,0,3,4,4,3`: Node 6 has parent 3, parent 0. Node 5 has parent 4, parent 3, parent 0. This is a valid tree.\nd. `5,4,3,0,2,3,4`: Node 1 has parent 5, parent 2, parent 3, parent 0 (three ancestors). This is a valid tree.\n\nOptions a, c and d are valid trees.\nOption a: 6->2->1->0 (3 ancestors)\nOption c: 5->4->3->0 (3 ancestors)\nOption d: 1->5->2->3->0 (4 ancestors)\n\nThe question asks for *at least* one node with three ancestors. All of the options a, c and d are valid. However, the prompt is ambiguous. It should be the vector of parents where the longest path from a node to the root is 3. In this case, the answer is c.\n\nThe answer is **c. 4,3,0,3,4,4,3**\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a directed graph representing fruit depots and transport bands. We need to find the minimum number of additional bands needed to create three strongly connected components, each containing depots with the same type of fruit.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Represent the graph visually or with an adjacency list/matrix.\n2. Identify the existing strongly connected components.\n3. Determine the connections needed to merge nodes with the same fruit type into strongly connected components.\n\n### Answer\nThe initial graph has the following edges:\n1 -> 5\n5 -> 2\n5 -> 4\n6 -> 1\n\nThe depots and their fruit types are:\n- Apples: 1, 3, 5\n- Pears: 2, 4\n- Peaches: 6\n\nWe want three strongly connected components: {1, 3, 5}, {2, 4}, and {6}.\n\nCurrently, there are no strongly connected components.\n\n1.  To make {1, 3, 5} strongly connected, we need to add edges: 5->1, 3->1, 1->3, 3->5. Since we already have 1->5, we need to add 5->1, 3->1, 1->3 and 3->5. However, we only want the *minimum* number of edges. We can add 5->1 (making 1 and 5 strongly connected). We can add 3 to this component by adding 1->3 and 3->5, or 3->1 and 5->3.\n2.  To make {2, 4} strongly connected, we need to add edges: 2->4 and 4->2.\n3.  {6} is already a strongly connected component (a single node is considered strongly connected to itself).\n\nTo connect 1,3,5 we can add 5->1. This makes 1 and 5 strongly connected.\nThen we need to connect 3. We can do this by adding 3->5 and 1->3.\nTo connect 2 and 4, we need 2->4 and 4->2.\n\nSo, we need to add:\n- 5 -> 1\n- 1 -> 3\n- 3 -> 5\n- 2 -> 4\n- 4 -> 2\nHowever, we can optimize this.\nWe already have 1->5, 5->2, 5->4.\nTo make {1,5} strongly connected, we add 5->1.\nTo connect 3, we can add 3->1 and 1->3.\nTo connect 2 and 4, we add 2->4 and 4->2.\nTo connect 6, we don't need any more edges.\n\nIf we have 1->5, 5->2, 5->4, and 6->1, we can add:\n- 2->4, 4->2 (to strongly connect 2 and 4)\n- 5->1 (to strongly connect 1 and 5)\n- 1->3, 3->5 (to strongly connect 3 with 1 and 5)\n\nThis requires 5 additional edges.\n\nHowever, if we add 2->4 and 4->2, we have {2,4} strongly connected.\nIf we add 5->1, we have {1,5} strongly connected.\nIf we add 3->1 and 5->3, we have {1,3,5} strongly connected.\n{6} is already strongly connected.\nThis requires 4 edges.\n\nThe answer is **a. 4**\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe pseudocode algorithm processes a number `x` digit by digit.  It extracts digits using integer division and the modulo operator.  It updates `x` based on whether the current digit is greater than the current maximum digit `m`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Trace the algorithm with the given input (6907512).\n2.  Understand the conditions for updating `m` and `x`.\n3.  Determine the final value of `x`.\n\n### Answer (a)\nLet's trace the execution with x = 6907512:\n\n| p    | m    | c    | Condition (c > m) | x         |\n|------|------|------|--------------------|-----------|\n| 1    | -1   | 2    | true               | 6907512   |\n| 10   | 2    | 1    | false              | 690752    |\n| 10   | 2    | 5    | true               | 690752    |\n| 100  | 5    | 7    | true               | 690752    |\n| 1000 | 7    | 0    | false              | 69752     |\n| 1000 | 7    | 9    | true               | 69752     |\n| 10000| 9    | 6    | false              | 9752      |\n\nSince m >= 0, the algorithm prints the final value of x, which is 9752.\n\nThe answer is **9752**\n\n### Answer (b)\nWe need to find two numbers in the range [100, 999] that remain unchanged after the algorithm's execution. This happens when the digits are in non-increasing order (from left to right).  For example, 987, 321, 555, 221, 111, etc.\n\nTwo such values are 111 and 221.\n\nThe answer is **111, 221** (or any other two distinct numbers with non-increasing digits in the specified range).\n\n### Answer (c)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, p, m, c;\n    cin >> x;\n    p = 1;\n    m = -1;\n    while (p <= x) {\n        c = (x / p) % 10;\n        if (c > m) {\n            m = c;\n            p = p * 10;\n        } else {\n            x = (x / (p * 10)) * p + x % p;\n        }\n    }\n    if (m >= 0) {\n        cout << x << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"nul\" << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Answer (d)\n```pseudocode\nciteşte x (număr natural)\n p1; m -1\nrepetă\n    c[x/p]%10\n    dacă c>m atunci\n        mc; pp*10\n    altfel\n        x[x/(p*10)]*p+x%p\n    sfarsit_daca\npână când p>x\ndacă m≥0 atunci scrie x\naltfel scrie \"nul\"\nsfarsit_daca\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis is a backtracking problem.

Understand the constraints: one saltwater source (mare or ocean) and one or two freshwater sources (lac, ploaie, râu).\n2. List the solutions in the specified order.\n3. Identify the solutions before and after (ocean, ploaie).\n\n### Answer\nThe solutions are generated in lexicographic order, considering the order of elements within each solution and the order of the sources: lac, mare, ocean, ploaie, râu.\n\nHere's the list of solutions, focusing on the relevant part:\n\n...\n(lac, ocean, râu)\n(mare, lac)\n(mare, lac, ploaie)\n(mare, lac, râu)\n(mare, ploaie)\n(mare, ploaie, lac)\n(mare, ploaie, râu)\n(mare, râu)\n(mare, râu, lac)\n(mare, râu, ploaie)\n(ocean, lac)\n(ocean, lac, ploaie)\n(ocean, lac, râu)\n(ocean, ploaie)\n(ocean, ploaie, lac)\n(ocean, ploaie, râu)\n(ocean, râu)\n...\n\nThe solution immediately before (ocean, ploaie) is (ocean, lac, râu).\nThe solution immediately after (ocean, ploaie) is (ocean, ploaie, lac).\n\nThe answer is **(ocean, lac, râu) and (ocean, ploaie, lac)**\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a C++ structure to store information about a tulip variety (name, stock, and price per flower).

Output the section number (row index + 1) and the column number (index of maximum depth + 1), separated by a colon and followed by a space.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int ns, np;\n    cin >> ns >> np;\n\n    vector<vector<int>> depths(ns, vector<int>(np));\n    for (int i = 0; i < ns; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < np; ++j) {\n            cin >> depths[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < ns; ++i) {\n        int max_depth = -1;\n        int max_index = -1;\n        for (int j = 0; j < np; ++j) {\n            if (depths[i][j] > max_depth) {\n                max_depth = depths[i][j];\n                max_index = j;\n            }\n        }\n        cout << i + 1 << \":\" << max_index + 1 << \" \";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given a file containing numbers. We need to count how many two-digit numbers appear the same number of times as a prefix and as a suffix of the numbers in the file.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Use two arrays, `prefix_count` and `suffix_count`, both of size 100, to store the counts of two-digit numbers (00-99) as prefixes and suffixes, respectively. Initialize them to 0.\n2.  Read each number from the file.\n3.  For each number, extract its two-digit prefix and suffix (if they exist).\n4.  Increment the corresponding counters in `prefix_count` and `suffix_count`.\n5.  After processing all numbers, iterate through the `prefix_count` and `suffix_count` arrays.\n6.  Count the number of positions where `prefix_count[i] == suffix_count[i]` and `prefix_count[i] > 0`.\n\n### Answer (a)\nThe algorithm uses two arrays to store the frequencies of two-digit numbers as prefixes and suffixes. It reads each number from the file, extracts the prefix and suffix (if applicable), and increments the corresponding counters. Finally, it compares the two frequency arrays and counts the number of two-digit numbers that have the same frequency as prefix and suffix. This approach is efficient because it reads the file only once (O(N) where N is the number of numbers in the file) and uses constant extra space (O(1) since the arrays have a fixed size of 100). The comparison of the frequency arrays takes O(1) time as well, as the size is fixed.\n\n### Answer (b)\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    vector<int> prefix_count(100, 0);\n    vector<int> suffix_count(100, 0);\n    int num;\n\n    while (fin >> num) {\n        // Extract prefix\n        int temp = num;\n        while (temp >= 100) {\n            temp /= 10;\n        }\n        if (temp >= 10) {\n            prefix_count[temp]++;\n        }\n\n        // Extract suffix\n        if (num >= 10) {\n          suffix_count[num % 100]++;\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int i = 10; i < 100; ++i) {\n        if (prefix_count[i] > 0 && prefix_count[i] == suffix_count[i]) {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << count << endl;\n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",
