We need to find its logical equivalent among the given options:\n- Option a: `!(x < 3 && x >= 10)` negates the impossible condition of x being simultaneously less than 3 and greater than or equal to 10.\n- Option b: `!(x < 3 || x >= 10)` negates x being less than 3 or greater than or equal to 10, which correctly captures the range 3 to 9.\n- Option c: `x < 3 && !(x >= 10)` is incorrect as x cannot be less than 3 and also not greater than or equal to 10.\n- Option d: `!(x < 3) || x >= 10` is incorrect as it allows x to be greater than or equal to 10.\n\n### Answer\nb. !(x < 3 || x >= 10)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nThe function `f(n,3)` should return 1 for any prime number n and 0 otherwise. We need to find the appropriate expression to replace the ellipsis in the recursive call.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function uses trial division to check for primality. The recursive call `return f(x,...)` should increment y such that it checks for divisibility by the next potential factor. Since `y*y > x` indicates no divisors were found, we need to increment y by 2 (since we're skipping even numbers).\n\n### Answer\na. y+2\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are generating combinations of three distinct fruits, ensuring that both quince and peach are not on the same plate. The solution immediately following `(quince, plum, apricot)` needs to be identified.\n\n### Solution Approach\nBacktracking is used to generate combinations. After `(quince, plum, apricot)`, the next combination should be `(quince, plum, peach)` as per the constraints and order.\n\n### Answer\nb. (quince, plum, peach)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nThe secondary diagonal of a square matrix with indices from 0 to 99 has elements where the sum of row and column indices equals 99.\n\n### Solution Approach\nGiven `A[20][j]`, for this element to be on the secondary diagonal, `20 + j = 99`. Solving for j gives j = 79.\n\n### Answer\nc. 79\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a graph with 7 nodes and 8 edges. We need to add two edges such that the longest elementary path is `[1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6]`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nTo maximize the path length while maintaining connectivity, we consider adding edges `[1,4]` and `[5,7]`. This connects nodes without disrupting the existing longest path.\n\n### Answer\nb. [1,4] and [5,7]\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze a pseudocode algorithm that modifies m and n based on their greatest common divisor (GCD) and determine outputs for specific inputs.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- **Part a:** For inputs 21 and 47, the algorithm calculates the GCD using the Euclidean method. The final value of n is decreased by 1 before the GCD calculation, resulting in GCD(21, 46). The GCD is 1, so n is 46, and `n+1` is 47.\n- **Part b:** For m = 5, choose n such that GCD(m, n-1) = 5. Possible values for n are 11 and 16 (since GCD(5, 10) = 5 and GCD(5, 15) = 5). \n- **Part c:** C++ implementation of the algorithm.\n- **Part d:** Write the pseudocode using a repeat-until loop.\n\n### Answer\na. 47  \nb. 11, 16  \nc.

Testing different roots, we find that if node 2 is the root, node 5 has siblings 3 and 7. Similarly, if node 8 is the root, node 5 has siblings 1 and 9.\n\n### Answer\n2, 8\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to display messages based on the temperature stored in a struct.\n\n### Solution Approach\nImplement conditional statements to check the temperature value and print the corresponding message.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstruct meteo {\n    int an, temperatura;\n} x;\n\nint main() {\n    // Assume x.temperatura is set elsewhere in the program\n    if (x.temperatura > 11) {\n        cout << \"CALDUROS\" << endl;\n    } else if (x.temperatura < 10) {\n        cout << \"RACOROS\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"NORMAL\" << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nThe subprogram `schimb` modifies a number by replacing a digit at a specified position.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will use arithmetic operations to isolate the digit at position p, replace it with x, and reconstruct the number.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid schimb(int &n, int x, int p) {\n    int power = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {\n        power *= 10;\n    }\n    int digit = (n / power) % 10;\n    n = n - digit * power + x * power;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n = 12587, x = 6, p = 3;\n    schimb(n, x, p);\n    cout << n << endl; // Output should be 16587\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to replace each consonant in a word with its \"friendly\" preceding vowel.\n\n### Solution Approach\nImplement a mapping from consonants to their friendly vowels and apply it to each character in the word.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nchar friendlyVowel(char c) {\n    if (c >= 'b' && c <= 'd') return 'a';\n    if (c >= 'f' && c <= 'h') return 'e';\n    if (c >= 'j' && c <= 'n') return 'i';\n    if (c >= 'p' && c <= 't') return 'o';\n    if (c >= 'v' && c <= 'z') return 'u';\n    return c; // Return the character if it's a vowel or invalid\n}\n\nint main() {\n    string parola;\n    cin >> parola;\n    for (char &c : parola) {\n        if (c != 'a' && c != 'e' && c != 'i' && c != 'o' && c != 'u') {\n            c = friendlyVowel(c);\n        }\n    }\n    cout << parola << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to compute the number and length of the longest parity sequence in a file with natural numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\nRead the file, track sequences of even or odd numbers, and determine the longest sequence.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <fstream>\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream file(\"bac.txt\");\n    int current, previous;\n    int maxLength = 0, currentLength = 1;\n    int maxCount = 0;\n\n    file >> previous;\n    while (file >> current) {\n        if ((current % 2) == (previous % 2)) {\n            currentLength++;\n        } else {\n            if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n                maxLength = currentLength;\n                maxCount = 1;\n            } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n                maxCount++;\n            }\n            currentLength = 1;\n        }\n        previous = current;\n    }\n    // Final check for the last sequence\n    if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n        maxLength = currentLength;\n        maxCount = 1;\n    } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n        maxCount++;\n    }\n\n    file.close();\n    cout << maxCount << \" \" << maxLength << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Description of Algorithm\n1.

    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.6": "Okay, let's break down each exercise and provide comprehensive solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks for an expression that is equivalent to `x >= 3 && x < 10`.  This means we need an expression that evaluates to 1 (true) if and only if `x` is greater than or equal to 3 AND less than 10.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe can use De Morgan's Laws to find equivalent expressions. De Morgan's Laws state:\n1.  `!(A && B)` is equivalent to `!A || !B`\n2.  `!(A || B)` is equivalent to `!A && !B`\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **b. !(x<3 || x>=10)**.\n\nLet's analyze why:\n\n*   The original expression `x >= 3 && x < 10` is true only when *both* conditions are true.\n*   Option b, `!(x < 3 || x >= 10)`, negates the condition where *either* `x < 3` OR `x >= 10` is true.\n*   By De Morgan's Law, `!(x < 3 || x >= 10)` is equivalent to `!(x < 3) && !(x >= 10)`, which simplifies to `x >= 3 && x < 10`.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **a. !(x<3 && x>=10):** This expression will be true for almost all values of x except for the impossible case of being smaller than 3 and greater than or equal to 10, at the same time.\n*   **c. x<3 && !(x>=10):** This is equivalent to x < 3 and x < 10, which is more restrictive.\n*   **d. !(x<3) || x>=10:** This is equivalent to x >= 3 or x >=10 which simplifies to x>=3.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe function `f(x, y)` is designed to check if a number `x` is prime. It recursively checks for divisibility, stopping when a divisor is found or when the square of the divisor `y` exceeds `x`. The initial call uses `y = 3`. We need to find the expression to replace the `...` to make the function correctly identify prime numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   `if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) return 0;`: Handles even numbers (except 2, which is prime).\n    *   `if (y * y > x) return 1;`: If the square of the potential divisor `y` is greater than `x`, then `x` is prime.\n    *   `if (x % y == 0) return 0;`: If `x` is divisible by `y`, it's not prime.\n2.  **Recursive Step:**  We need to increment `y` to check the next potential divisor. Since we've already handled even numbers, we only need to check odd divisors.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **a. y+2**.\n\nThe recursive call should be `f(x, y + 2)`. This ensures that only odd numbers are checked as potential divisors, maintaining the efficiency of the primality test.  The other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **b. y-2:** This would cause an infinite loop or incorrect results.\n*  **c. y\\*2:** This would skip potential divisors.\n*   **d. y/2:** This will not work and may cause infinite loop.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis problem involves generating combinations of fruits using backtracking.  The constraint is that \"gutuie\" (quince) and \"piersică\" (peach) cannot be on the same plate. We need to find the combination that comes immediately after (gutuie, prună, caisă).\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's list the fruits in order: măr, gutuie, prună, caisă, piersică. We'll follow the backtracking algorithm, keeping the constraint in mind.\n\n1.  (măr, gutuie, prună)\n2.  (măr, gutuie, caisă)\n3.  (măr, prună, caisă)\n4.  (măr, prună, piersică)\n5.  (măr, caisă, piersică)\n6.  (gutuie, prună, caisă)\n7.  We need to find the next combination. Following the lexicographic order and the constraint: since 'gutuie' is fixed, and we can not combine it with 'piersica', we need to find the next possible fruit after 'caisa'. 'Piersica' is not allowed, hence we roll back. We change 'pruna' to 'caisa'. Then we have gutuie, caisa, and we need a third fruit. It can be 'mar'.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **c. (mar, caisă, piersică)**.\n\nThe order of generation is lexicographic, with the constraint applied. After (gutuie, prună, caisă), the next possibility is (măr, caisă, piersică).\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 100x100 2D array `A`. We need to find the column index `j` such that `A[20][j]` lies on the secondary diagonal.\n\n### Solution Approach\nOn the secondary diagonal of a square matrix, the sum of the row and column indices is always equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the size of the matrix (number of rows or columns).  In this case, `n = 100`.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **c. 79**.\n\nWe have `row + column = n - 1`.  Given the row is 20, we have:\n`20 + j = 100 - 1`\n`20 + j = 99`\n`j = 99 - 20`\n`j = 79`\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe're given an undirected graph with 7 nodes and 8 edges. Six edges are provided, along with a longest elementary chain. We must determine the remaining two edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Visualize:** Draw the graph with the given six edges:\n    *   1-2-4-5\n    *   |\n    *   7\n    *   |\n    *   3  6\n2.  **Longest Chain:** The given longest chain is 1-2-7-5-4-6. This chain uses all 7 nodes.  This suggests the graph is likely a connected graph without cycles (a tree) or a graph with few additional edges.\n3.  **Missing Edges:** We need to add two edges. Since the given chain is the longest, adding edges that create shorter paths or cycles is not possible. We must connect nodes that are \"far apart\" in the current graph.\n4. Consider the current connections. The given path uses nodes 1,2,4,5,6,7. Node 3 is only connected to 4.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **d. [3,6] and [5,7]**.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n*   **a. [1,4] and [4,7]:**  [1,4] would create a cycle (1-2-4-1), and [4,7] would create a cycle (2-4-7-2), and the longest path would be shorter.\n*   **b. [1,4] and [5,7]:** [1,4] creates a cycle (1-2-4-1). [5,7] create a cycle (2-7-5-4-2).\n*   **c. [2,5] and [4,7]:** [2,5] creates a cycle (2-4-5-2). [4,7] create a cycle (2-4-7-2)\n*   **d. [3,6] and [5,7]:** Adding [3,6] connects node 3 to the rest of the graph without creating a cycle.  Adding [5,7] create a cycle (2-7-5-4-2). However, this option is the closest to the correct answer, because if we consider the longest elementary chain to be 1,2,4,5,6,3,7, then [5,7] and [3,6] are possible edges.\n\nThe provided longest chain is misleading, since in option d, with edges [3,6] and [5,7], there is another elementary chain of length 6 (maximum possible since it is elementary): 1,2,7,5,4,6,3.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `m` and `n` repeatedly, decrementing `n` in each outer loop iteration. The final output is `n + 1`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe will trace the algorithm for each part.\n\n**(a)**\n*   m = 21, n = 47\n*   x = 1\n*   Loop 1:\n    *   x = 21, y = 47, n = 46\n    *   GCD(21, 47) = 1\n*   Loop 2:\n    *   x = 21, y = 46, n = 45\n    *   GCD(21, 46) = 1\n*  ... The outer loop continues until n becomes smaller than m.\n*   Loop (47-21) = 26:\n    *   x = 21, y = 22, n = 21\n    *   GCD(21,22) = 1\n* Loop 27:\n    * x = 21, y = 21, n = 20\n    * GCD(21, 21) = 21. x becomes equal to y, inner while loop terminates.\n* Outer loop terminates since x is no longer 1.\n* Output n+1 = 20 + 1 = 21\n\n**(b)**\n* m = 5. We need to find two values of n such that the final output (n+1) is 11, which means the final value of n is 10.\n* The algorithm stops when x != 1, which means the GCD(m, n_current) != 1.\n* n_initial - n_final = number of outer loops.\n* GCD(5, n_current) != 1, only if n_current is a multiple of 5.\n* If n_final is 10, n_current must be 10. Since 10 is a multiple of 5, GCD(5,10) = 5, x will not be 1, outer loop terminates.\n    * First value for n_initial: 11. n will become 10 after one outer loop.\n    * Second value for n_initial: 16. n will decrease by 1 at each step until n = 10.\n\n**(c)**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int m, n, x, y;\n    std::cin >> m >> n;\n\n    x = 1;\n    while (x == 1) {\n        x = m;\n        y = n;\n        n = n - 1;\n        while (x != y) {\n            if (x > y) {\n                x = x - y;\n            } else {\n                y = y - x;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    std::cout << n + 1 << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**(d)**\n\n```pseudocode\nciteşte m,n\n (numere naturale nenule, m<n)\n x1\n|repeta\n| xm; yn; nn-1\n||cât timp x≠y execută\n|||dacă x>y atunci xx-y\n||||altfel yy-x\n|||■\n||■\n|pana cand x!=1\nscrie n+1\n```\n\n### Answer\n**(a)** 21\n**(b)** 11 and 16\n**(c)** See C++ code above.\n**(d)** See pseudocode above.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe're given a tree with 9 nodes and a list of edges. We need to find two nodes that, if chosen as the root, would make node 5 have two siblings.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Visualize:** Draw the tree based on the given edges.\n2.  **Siblings:** Siblings are nodes that share the same parent.\n3.  **Root:** If a node is the root, all other nodes are its descendants.\n4.  **Node 5's Parent:** To have siblings, node 5 must have a parent.  We need to find a root that makes node 5 have two other children under the same parent.\n5. Draw the tree.\n   ```\n       1      2\n       |     /|\\\n       8    3 5 7\n      / \\    / \\\n     9   5   4   6\n\n   ```\n\n### Answer\nNodes 2 and 8.\n\n*   **If 2 is the root:** Node 5's parent is 2.  The children of 2 are 3, 5, and 7.  Therefore, 5's siblings are 3 and 7 (two siblings).\n*   **If 8 is the root:** Node 5's parent is 8.  The children of 8 are 1, 5, and 9.  Therefore, 5's siblings are 1 and 9 (two siblings).\n*   If 1 is root, 5's parent is 8. Siblings: 9. Only one sibling.\n*   If 3 is root, 5's parent is 2. Siblings: 7. Only one sibling.\n*   If 4 is root, 5's parent is 4. Siblings: 6. Only one sibling.\n*   If 5 is root, it has no parent, no siblings.\n*    If 6 is root, 5's parent is 5.

It replaces the digit at position `p` in `n` with `x`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Find the digit to replace:**  We can isolate the digit at position `p` using division and modulo operations.\n2.  **Calculate the power of 10:** We need 10<sup>p</sup> to work with the digit at position `p`.\n3.  **Remove the digit:** Subtract the original digit's value from `n`.\n4.  **Add the new digit:** Add the new digit's value (x \\* 10<sup>p</sup>) to `n`.\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nvoid schimb(long long &n, int x, int p) {\n    long long powerOf10 = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {\n        powerOf10 *= 10;\n    }\n\n    long long originalDigit = (n / powerOf10) % 10;\n    n = n - originalDigit * powerOf10;\n    n = n + x * powerOf10;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    long long n = 12587;\n    int x = 6;\n    int p = 3;\n    schimb(n, x, p);\n    std::cout << n << std::endl; // Output: 16587\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to codify a password by replacing each consonant with its \"vowel friend.\" A vowel friend is the vowel that precedes the consonant in the alphabet, with no other vowels in between.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Iterate:** Loop through the input string (password).\n2.  **Check for Consonants:** For each character, check if it's a consonant.\n3.  **Find Vowel Friend:** If it's a consonant, find its vowel friend.\n4.  **Replace:** Replace the consonant with its vowel friend.\n5. **Vowel friend logic**:\n    * Consonants before 'e': vowel friend is 'a'\n    * Consonants between 'e' and 'i': vowel friend is 'e'\n    * Consonants between 'i' and 'o': vowel friend is 'i'\n    * Consonants between 'o' and 'u': vowel friend is 'o'\n    * Consonants after 'u': vowel friend is 'u'\n\n### Answer\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <cctype>\n\nchar vowelFriend(char c) {\n    if (c >= 'b' && c <= 'd') return 'a';\n    if (c >= 'f' && c <= 'h') return 'e';\n    if (c >= 'j' && c <= 'n') return 'i';\n    if (c >= 'p' && c <= 't') return 'o';\n    if (c >= 'v' && c <= 'z') return 'u';\n    return c; // Should not happen for consonants\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string password;\n    std::cin >> password;\n\n    for (char &c : password) { // Iterate by reference to modify the string\n        if (!strchr(\"aeiou\", c) && isalpha(c))\n        {\n          c = vowelFriend(c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    std::cout << password << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the number of maximum-length sequences of consecutive numbers with the same parity in a file and the length of those sequences.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Read File:** Read numbers from the file one by one.\n2.  **Track Current Sequence:** Keep track of the current sequence length (`currentLength`) and its parity (`currentParity`).\n3.  **Track Max Sequence:** Keep track of the maximum sequence length (`maxLength`) and the number of times this maximum length has occurred (`maxCount`).\n4.  **Compare:**\n    *   If the current number has the same parity as the current sequence, increment `currentLength`.\n    *   If the current number has a different parity, check if `currentLength` is greater than or equal to `maxLength`.\n        *   If `currentLength > maxLength`, update `maxLength` and reset `maxCount` to 1.\n        *   If `currentLength == maxLength`, increment `maxCount`.\n    *   Reset `currentLength` to 1 and update `currentParity`.\n5.  **Handle Last Sequence:** After reading all numbers, check if the last sequence needs to be compared to `maxLength`.\n\n### Answer\n**(a) Algorithm Description and Justification**\n\nThe algorithm reads the numbers from the file sequentially. It maintains a `currentLength` variable to track the length of the current sequence of numbers with the same parity and a `currentParity` variable to store the parity of the current sequence.  It also keeps track of `maxLength` (the maximum sequence length found so far) and `maxCount` (the number of times the maximum length has been encountered).\n\nWhen a number with a different parity is encountered, or the end of the file is reached, the algorithm compares the current sequence length (`currentLength`) with the maximum length found so far (`maxLength`). If `currentLength` is greater, `maxLength` is updated, and `maxCount` is reset to 1. If they are equal, `maxCount` is incremented.  This ensures we correctly count all maximal sequences.\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of numbers in the file.  We iterate through the file once.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a fixed number of variables, regardless of the input size.\n\n**(b) C++ Code**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream file(\"bac.txt\");\n    int num;\n    int currentLength = 0;\n    int maxLength = 0;\n    int maxCount = 0;\n    int currentParity = -1; // Initialize to an invalid parity\n\n    if (file >> num) { // Read the first number\n        currentLength = 1;\n        currentParity = num % 2;\n    }\n\n    while (file >> num) {\n        if (num % 2 == currentParity) {\n            currentLength++;\n        } else {\n            if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n                maxLength = currentLength;\n                maxCount = 1;\n            } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n                maxCount++;\n            }\n            currentLength = 1;\n            currentParity = num % 2;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check the last sequence\n    if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n        maxLength = currentLength;\n        maxCount = 1;\n    } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n        maxCount++;\n    }\n\n    std::cout << maxCount << \" \" << maxLength << std::endl;\n\n    file.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

This requires understanding logical operations and De Morgan's laws.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe original expression `x>=3 && x<10` means x is in the range [3,10).\nLet's analyze each option using logical equivalence:\n- Option a: `!(x<3 && x>=10)` = `!x<3 || !x>=10` = `x>=3 || x<10`\n- Option b: `!(x<3 || x>=10)` = `!x<3 && !x>=10` = `x>=3 && x<10`\n- Option c: `x<3 && !(x>=10)` = `x<3 && x<10` = `x<3`\n- Option d: `!(x<3) || x>=10` = `x>=3 || x>=10` = `x>=3`\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is b. `!(x<3 || x>=10)`\n\nThis is equivalent to the original expression by De Morgan's law, which states that the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the recursive call parameter for function `f` so that it returns 1 for prime numbers and 0 otherwise.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function checks if:\n1. `x` is even but not 2, returning 0 (as non-prime)\n2. If `y*y > x`, returns 1 (we've checked all possible divisors)\n3. If `x` is divisible by `y`, returns 0 (as non-prime)\n4. Otherwise recursively calls itself with parameters `x` and a new value for `y`\n\nFor a prime number check, we need to test all potential divisors from 2 up to √x. The function starts with `y=3`, so we need to increment `y` in each recursive call.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is a. `y+2`\n\nThe function is checking odd divisors starting from 3 (since even divisors are handled by the first condition). By incrementing `y` by 2 each time, we check 3, 5, 7, etc., which is the correct approach for checking primality after already handling the even case.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the solution generated immediately after (gutuie, prună, caisă) in a backtracking algorithm that generates all possible combinations of 3 distinct fruits from the set {măr, gutuie, prună, caisă, piersică}, with the constraint that gutuie and piersică cannot be on the same platter.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's map the fruits to numbers for easier analysis:\n1 = măr, 2 = gutuie, 3 = prună, 4 = caisă, 5 = piersică\n\nThe constraint is that 2 (gutuie) and 5 (piersică) cannot appear together.\n\nThe first four solutions are:\n(1,2,3) = (măr, gutuie, prună)\n(1,2,4) = (măr, gutuie, caisă)\n(1,3,4) = (măr, prună, caisă)\n(1,3,5) = (măr, prună, piersică)\n\nWe need to find what comes after (2,3,4) = (gutuie, prună, caisă).\n\nFollowing the lexicographic order in backtracking, the next solution would be (2,3,5), but this violates our constraint that gutuie and piersică cannot be together.\n\nSo the next valid solution would be (3,4,5) = (prună, caisă, piersică).\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is d.

We also know that one of the elementary paths of maximum length is 1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6. We need to determine the other two edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFirst, let's analyze the given path: 1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6\nThis path uses the edges [1,2], [2,7], [5,7], [4,5], [4,6].\n\nWait, [5,7] is not in our list of known edges. This means [5,7] must be one of the two unknown edges.\n\nThe other unknown edge must connect the remaining nodes in a way that makes the given path a maximum length path. Looking at the options and the known edges, we need an edge that doesn't create a longer path.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is d. [3,6] and [5,7]\n\nThe edge [5,7] must be present to make the given path valid. The edge [3,6] connects the remaining nodes without creating a longer path.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze an algorithm, predict its output for given inputs, find inputs for a specified output, convert it to C++, and rewrite it using a do-while loop instead of a while loop.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's trace the algorithm:\n1. Read m, n (m < n)\n2. Set x = 1\n3. While x = 1:\n   a. Set x = m, y = n, n = n-1\n   b. While x ≠ y:\n      i. If x > y then x = x-y\n      ii. Else y = y-x\n4. Output n+1\n\n#### a) For m=21, n=47:\n- x=1 (initially)\n- First iteration of outer loop:\n  - x=21, y=47, n=46\n  - Inner loop: Find gcd(21,47) using Euclidean algorithm\n  - 47 = 2×21 + 5, so y becomes 5\n  - 21 = 4×5 + 1, so x becomes 1\n  - 5 = 5×1 + 0, so y becomes 0 (not possible in this algorithm)\n  - Actually, when x=1, y=5, then y=y-x=4, then y=3, y=2, y=1, now x=y=1, exit inner loop\n  - x=1 after inner loop, so continue outer loop\n- Second iteration of outer loop:\n  - x=21, y=46, n=45\n  - Inner loop: Find gcd(21,46)\n  - Eventually x=1, continue outer loop\n- This continues until x≠1 after the inner loop\n\nTo determine when this happens, we need to find when gcd(m,n)≠1.\nFor m=21, n=47, then n=46, 45, 44... we get gcd=1 until n=42, where gcd(21,42)=21≠1.\n\nSo the algorithm stops when n=42, and outputs 42+1=43.\n\n#### b) For m=5, to get output 10:\nWe need n+1=10, so n=9.\nThe algorithm stops when gcd(m,n)≠1.\nFor m=5, we need to find values of n where gcd(5,n)≠1, which means n must be divisible by 5.\nTwo possible values are n=15 and n=20, which would make the algorithm stop with n=10 and n=15 respectively, outputting 11 and 16.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me reconsider...\n\nFor output 10, we need n=9 when the algorithm stops.\nThe algorithm stops when gcd(m,n)≠1.\nFor m=5, n must be a multiple of 5.\nIf n=10, then after one iteration, n=9, and gcd(5,9)=1, so it continues.\nIf n=15, then after one iteration, n=14, and so on until n=10, then n=9, and gcd(5,9)=1, so it continues.\n\nLet me trace more carefully:\nFor m=5, if n=14:\n- First iteration: x=5, y=14, n=13. After inner loop, x=1 (gcd=1).\n- Iterations continue until n=9, where x=5, y=9, n=8.\n- gcd(5,9)=1, so x=1, and we continue.\n- Next iteration: x=5, y=8, n=7.\n- gcd(5,8)=1, so x=1, and we continue.\n- When n=5, we have x=5, y=5, n=4. After inner loop, x=0 (gcd=5).\n- Since x≠1, we exit and output n+1=5.\n\nSo for n=14, the output is 5, not 10.\n\nLet me try n=19:\n- Iterations continue until n=10, where x=5, y=10, n=9.\n- gcd(5,10)=5, so x=0, and we exit.\n- Output n+1=10.\n\nSo one answer is n=19. \n\nFor the second answer, we could use n=9:\n- First iteration: x=5, y=9, n=8. After inner loop, x=1 (gcd=1).\n- Iterations continue until n=5, where x=5, y=5, n=4.\n- After inner loop, x=0 (gcd=5).\n- Output n+1=5.\n\nThat's not 10. Let me try n=24:\n- Iterations continue until n=15, where x=5, y=15, n=14.\n- gcd(5,15)=5, so x=0, and we exit.\n- Output n+1=15.\n\nNot 10 either. Let me try n=14:\n- Iterations continue until n=10, where x=5, y=10, n=9.\n- gcd(5,10)=5, so x=0, and we exit.\n- Output n+1=10.\n\nSo the two answers are n=14 and n=19.\n\n### Answer\na) For m=21 and n=47, the output is 43.\n\nb) For m=5, two values of n that produce output 10 are 14 and 19.\n\nc) C++ program:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int m, n, x, y;\n    cin >> m >> n;\n    \n    x = 1;\n    while (x == 1) {\n        x = m;\n        y = n;\n        n = n - 1;\n        \n        while (x != y) {\n            if (x > y)\n                x = x - y;\n            else\n                y = y - x;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    cout << n + 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd) Pseudocode with do-while:\n```\nciteşte m,n (numere naturale nenule, m<n)\nx1\nrepetă\n    xm; yn; nn-1\n    cât timp x≠y execută\n        dacă x>y atunci xx-y\n        altfel yy-x\npână când x≠1\nscrie n+1\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find two possible root nodes for a tree with 9 nodes, such that node 5 has exactly two \"brothers\" (siblings). In a tree, siblings are nodes that share the same parent.\n\n### Solution Approach\nGiven edges: [1,8], [2,3], [2,5], [2,7], [4,5], [5,6], [5,8], [8,9]\n\nFirst, let's identify the structure of the tree. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.\nFor node 5 to have exactly two siblings, its parent must have exactly three children including node 5.\n\nIf we choose node 2 as the root:\n- Children of node 2: 3, 5, 7\n- Node 5 has siblings 3 and 7\n- This works!\n\nIf we choose node 8 as the root:\n- Children of node 8: 1, 5, 9\n- Node 5 has siblings 1 and 9\n- This works too!\n\nLet's check other nodes:\n- Node 1: Not possible (only connected to node 8)\n- Node 3: Not possible (only connected to node 2)\n- Node 4: If root, node 5 has no siblings\n- Node 6: Not possible (only connected to node 5)\n- Node 7: Not possible (only connected to node 2)\n- Node 9: Not possible (only connected to node 8)\n\n### Answer\nTwo nodes that can be chosen as the root are 2 and 8.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write code that checks the temperature value in a struct and displays a message based on its value.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe struct contains an `an` (year) field and a `temperatura` (temperature) field.

Define the vowels of the English alphabet\n2. For each character in the password:\n   - If it's a vowel, keep it as is\n   - If it's a consonant, replace it with its friendly vowel\n\nThe friendly vowel for a consonant is:\n- 'a' for consonants 'b', 'c', 'd'\n- 'e' for consonants 'f', 'g', 'h'\n- 'i' for consonants 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'\n- 'o' for consonants 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't'\n- 'u' for consonants 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    char parola[51];\n    char rezultat[51];\n    \n    cin >> parola;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(parola); i++) {\n        char c = parola[i];\n        \n        // Check if it's a vowel\n        if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {\n            rezultat[i] = c;\n        } else {\n            // Replace consonant with its friendly vowel\n            if (c >= 'b' && c <= 'd') rezultat[i] = 'a';\n            else if (c >= 'f' && c <= 'h') rezultat[i] = 'e';\n            else if (c >= 'j' && c <= 'n') rezultat[i] = 'i';\n            else if (c >= 'p' && c <= 't') rezultat[i] = 'o';\n            else rezultat[i] = 'u';\n        }\n    }\n    \n    rezultat[strlen(parola)] = '\\0';\n    cout << rezultat;\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the maximum length of consecutive numbers with the same parity (all even or all odd) in a sequence, and count how many such maximum-length sequences exist.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read numbers one by one from the file\n2. Keep track of the current sequence length, the maximum length found, and the count of sequences with maximum length\n3. When the parity changes, update the maximum length and count if needed\n4. Use a single pass through the data for efficiency\n\n### Solution Description\na. The algorithm works as follows:\n1. Initialize variables for current sequence length, maximum length, and count\n2. Read each number from the file one by one\n3. If it's the first number, set the current parity\n4. For each subsequent number:\n   - If it has the same parity as the previous number, increment the current sequence length\n   - If it has different parity, check if the current sequence length is equal to or greater than the maximum:\n     - If greater, update the maximum and set count to 1\n     - If equal, increment the count\n     - Reset current sequence length to 1 and update current parity\n5. After reading all numbers, check once more if the last sequence affects the result\n6. Output the count and maximum length\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n- It uses O(1) extra space (just a few variables)\n- It processes the data in a single pass, making it O(n) time complexity\n- It doesn't need to store the entire sequence in memory\n\n### Answer\nb. Program code:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    \n    int numar, numarAnterior;\n    int lungimeCurenta = 1;\n    int lungimeMaxima = 0;\n    int numarSecvente = 0;\n    bool paritateaCurenta;\n    \n    // Read the first number to establish initial parity\n    fin >> numarAnterior;\n    paritateaCurenta = (numarAnterior % 2 == 0);\n    \n    while (fin >> numar) {\n        bool paritateaNoua = (numar % 2 == 0);\n        \n        if (paritateaNoua == paritateaCurenta) {\n            // Same parity, continue the sequence\n            lungimeCurenta++;\n        } else {\n            // Different parity, end of sequence\n            if (lungimeCurenta > lungimeMaxima) {\n                lungimeMaxima = lungimeCurenta;\n                numarSecvente = 1;\n            } else if (lungimeCurenta == lungimeMaxima) {\n                numarSecvente++;\n            }\n            \n            // Start a new sequence\n            lungimeCurenta = 1;\n            paritateaCurenta = paritateaNoua;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Check the last sequence\n    if (lungimeCurenta > lungimeMaxima) {\n        lungimeMaxima = lungimeCurenta;\n        numarSecvente = 1;\n    } else if (lungimeCurenta == lungimeMaxima) {\n        numarSecvente++;\n    }\n    \n    cout << numarSecvente << \" \" << lungimeMaxima;\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```"
