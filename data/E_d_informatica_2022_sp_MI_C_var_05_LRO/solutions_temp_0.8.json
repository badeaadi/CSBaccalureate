The candidate expressions are given as options.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- We need to evaluate each option and check if it correctly negates the original condition.\n- The original condition is true for `x` in the range [3, 10).\n\n### Answer\nOption b. `!(x<3 || x>=10)` is correct. This is because `!(x<3 || x>=10)` simplifies to `x >= 3 && x < 10`, which directly matches the original condition.\n\n---\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nThe function `f(n,3)` should return 1 if `n` is a prime number and 0 otherwise. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- The function checks if `n` is not 2 and even, returning 0.\n- The check `if(y*y>x)` implies testing divisors up to the square root of `x`.\n- The solution involves incrementing `y` correctly to continue checking divisibility.\n\n### Answer\nOption a. `y+2` is correct. This increments `y` by 2, ensuring we check only odd divisors, which is efficient for testing primality beyond checking divisibility by 2.\n\n---\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to generate fruit combinations without gutuie and piersică appearing together.

    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.8": "Okay, I'm ready to tackle these exercises. Here's a breakdown of each, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks for an expression equivalent to `x >= 3 && x < 10`.  This expression is true if and only if x is in the range [3, 10), i.e., greater than or equal to 3 AND strictly less than 10. We need to find an expression among the options that has the same truth value for all possible integer values of x.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe can use De Morgan's laws to analyze the options. De Morgan's laws state:\n1.  `!(A && B)` is equivalent to `!A || !B`\n2.  `!(A || B)` is equivalent to `!A && !B`\n\nWe are given `x >= 3 && x < 10`. Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a. `!(x < 3 && x >= 10)`:**  The inner expression `(x < 3 && x >= 10)` is always false, because a number cannot be simultaneously less than 3 and greater than or equal to 10.  Therefore, its negation is always true. This is NOT equivalent to the original expression.\n*   **b. `!(x < 3 || x >= 10)`:** Applying De Morgan's law, this is equivalent to `!(x < 3) && !(x >= 10)`, which simplifies to `x >= 3 && x < 10`. This IS equivalent to the original expression.\n*   **c. `x < 3 && !(x >= 10)`:** This simplifies to `x < 3 && x < 10`, which is equivalent to `x < 3`. This is NOT equivalent to the original expression.\n*   **d. `!(x < 3) || x >= 10`:** This simplifies to `x >= 3 || x >= 10`, which is equivalent to `x >= 3`. This is NOT equivalent to the original expression.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **b. `!(x < 3 || x >= 10)`**.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe function `f(x, y)` is designed to check if `x` is a prime number.  It first handles the base cases: even numbers other than 2 are not prime (returns 0), and if `y*y > x`, then x is prime (returns 1). It recursively calls itself, and we must determine the expression to replace the \".........\" to correctly implement the primality test.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe recursive step should check if `x` is divisible by `y`. If it is, `x` is not prime (returns 0).  If not, we need to continue checking divisibility by the *next* potential divisor. Since the function already handles even numbers, we only need to check odd divisors. Therefore, we should increment `y` by 2 in each recursive call.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **a. y+2**.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem describes a backtracking algorithm generating combinations of 3 fruits from a set of 5, with the constraint that \"gutuie\" (quince) and \"piersică\" (peach) cannot be together. We are given the first four solutions and need to find the solution immediately following (gutuie, prună, caisă).\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's represent the fruits by their first letters: m (măr), g (gutuie), p (prună), c (caisă), i (piersică). The given solutions are:\n1. (m, g, p)\n2. (m, g, c)\n3. (m, p, c)\n4. (m, p, i)\n5. (g, p, c) - The one we are after\n\nWe need to follow the backtracking logic. After (g, p, c), we try to increment the last element.  'c' cannot be incremented to 'i' because 'g' and 'i' cannot be together. So, we backtrack.  We increment 'p' to the next valid choice which, *must be* the combination where 'g' is replace by 'm', we have to find the next lexicographical combination, starting with those fruits. We should follow this order (m, c, i)\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **c. (mar, caisă, piersică)**.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 100x100 2D array `A`. We need to find the value of `j` such that `A[20][j]` lies on the secondary diagonal.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe secondary diagonal of a square matrix consists of elements where the sum of the row and column indices is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the size of the matrix (number of rows or columns). In this case, `n = 100`.  So, for an element `A[i][j]` on the secondary diagonal, `i + j = 100 - 1 = 99`.  We are given that the row index `i` is 20. Therefore, `20 + j = 99`.\n\n### Answer\nSolving for `j`, we get `j = 99 - 20 = 79`. The correct answer is **c. 79**.\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have an undirected graph with 7 nodes and 8 edges. Six edges are given, along with a longest elementary chain. We need to determine the remaining two edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's visualize the graph with the given edges:\n\n```\n1 -- 2 -- 4 -- 5\n     |   / \\\n     7  3   6\n```\n\nThe given longest chain is 1-2-7-5-4-6. This chain uses all nodes except node 3. Node 3 is currently connected to node 4. Any additional longest chain that uses the same nodes, needs a link to node 1 or node 6.\n\nThe longest path uses all seven nodes.  Let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **a. \\[1,4] and \\[4,7]:**  Adding these edges doesn't create a longer chain and creates cycles.\n*   **b. \\[1,4] and \\[5,7]:**  Adding these edges doesn't create a longer chain and creates cycles.\n*   **c. \\[2,5] and \\[4,7]:**  Adding these edges doesn't create a longer chain and creates cycles.\n*   **d. \\[3,6] and \\[5,7]:** If you look closely to the longest chain, it is composed of the edges 1-2, 2-7, 7-5, 5-4, 4-6. Adding 3-6 and 5-7, the longest elementary chain starts at node 3, and it will traverse all the nodes. There will be other long chains as well. This option fits the given condition.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **d. \\[3,6] and \\[5,7]**.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm takes two numbers, `m` and `n`, and repeatedly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` (initialized as `m` and `n`), decrementing `n` in each outer loop iteration. The outer loop continues as long as `x` is 1. Finally, it prints `n + 1`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n*   **a.**  We need to trace the algorithm with `m = 21` and `n = 47`.\n*   **b.**  We need to find two values of `n` (with `m = 5`) such that the final output is 11, which is the initial value of n after exiting the outer loop, + 1.\n*   **c.**  Translate the pseudocode directly into C++.\n*   **d.**  Rewrite the outer `while` loop as a `do-while` loop.\n\n### Answer\n\n**a.**\n1.  `m = 21`, `n = 47`, `x = 1`\n2.  Outer loop (x == 1):\n    *   `x = 21`, `y = 47`, `n = 46`\n    *   Inner loop (x != y): GCD(21, 47) = 1. After the inner loop, `x = 1`, `y = 1`.\n3.  Outer loop (x == 1):\n    *   `x = 21`, `y = 46`, `n = 45`\n    *   Inner loop. GCD(21, 46) = 1. After inner loop: `x = 1`, `y = 1`\n... The loop continues until n is decremented so much that GCD(21, n) != 1.\nGCD(21, n) will be different of 1 when n is a multiple of 3 or 7.\nLet's manually run a couple iterations until n=42.\n- n = 47. x = 21, y = 47. GCD(21,47) = 1\n- n = 46. x = 21, y = 46. GCD(21,46) = 1\n- n = 45. x = 21, y = 45. GCD(21,45) = 3. x=3, y=3\n- n = 44. x=1.\n- ...\n- n = 42. x = 21, y = 42, GCD(21,42) = 21. x and y become 21.\nOuter loop condition fails.\nOutput: `n + 1 = 42 + 1 = 43`.\n\n**b.**\nThe algorithm will print 11 (10+1) if the outer loop terminates when n becomes 10.\nThe initial value of n must be such that when we repeatedly calculate the GCD of x(initially 5) and n, after each complete iteration, n is decremented by 1, and the GCD will be 1, until n is 10.\nSo, we have m = 5.\nIf we input n=11, GCD(5,11) = 1, then n becomes 10. x will be 1.\nIf we input n=12, GCD(5,12) = 1, then n becomes 11, then we have GCD(5,11) = 1, and n becomes 10.\nSo the two values could be 11 and 12.\n\n**c.**\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int m, n, x, y;\n    std::cin >> m >> n;\n    x = 1;\n    while (x == 1) {\n        x = m;\n        y = n;\n        n = n - 1;\n        while (x != y) {\n            if (x > y) {\n                x = x - y;\n            } else {\n                y = y - x;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    std::cout << n + 1 << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**d.**\n```pseudocode\nciteşte m,n\n (numere naturale nenule, m<n)\n x1\nrepeta\n    xm; yn; nn-1\n    ┌cât timp x≠y execută\n    │┌dacă x>y atunci xx-y\n    ││altfel yy-x\n    │└■\n    └■\npana cand x!=1\nscrie n+1\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nGiven a tree's edges, we need to find two possible roots such that node 5 has two siblings.\n\n### Solution Approach\nA node has siblings if they share the same parent.  We are looking for roots where node 5 has two siblings.  Let's visualize the tree:\n\n```\n      1       2      4\n      |      /|\\     |\n      8     3 5 7    5\n     / \\       |    / \\\n    9   5      6   6   8\n        |             / \\\n        6            9   5\n                     |\n                     6\n\n```\nIf 8 is a root: 1, 5, 9 are children of 8. 5 has two siblings (1 and 9)\nIf 2 is a root: 3, 5, 7 are children of 2. 5 has two siblings (3 and 7).\n\n### Answer\nTwo possible roots are 8 and 2.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a `struct meteo` storing a year and temperature. We need to print \"CALDUROS\", \"RACOROS\", or \"NORMAL\" based on the temperature.\n\n### Solution Approach\nUse `if-else if-else` statements to check the temperature against the given thresholds (11 and 10).\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nstruct meteo {\n    int an;\n    int temperatura;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    meteo x;\n    std::cin >> x.an >> x.temperatura;  //Assuming input is provided\n\n    if (x.temperatura > 11) {\n        std::cout << \"CALDUROS\" << std::endl;\n    } else if (x.temperatura < 10) {\n        std::cout << \"RACOROS\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"NORMAL\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe `schimb` function takes an integer `n`, a digit `x`, and a position `p`. It replaces the digit at position `p` in `n` with `x`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Find the digit at position `p`.\n2.  Calculate the value to subtract (the original digit at position `p` multiplied by the corresponding power of 10).\n3.  Calculate the value to add (the new digit `x` multiplied by the corresponding power of 10).\n4.

The vowel friend is the vowel immediately preceding the consonant in the alphabet, with no other vowels in between.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Iterate through the input string (password).\n2.  For each character, check if it's a consonant.\n3.  If it's a consonant, find its vowel friend.\n4.  Replace the consonant with its vowel friend.\n5.

Read the numbers from the file one by one.\n2.  Keep track of the current sequence length (`currentLength`) and the maximum sequence length (`maxLength`).\n3.  Keep track of number of maximum sequences (`maxCount`).\n4.  If the current number has the same parity as the previous number, increment `currentLength`.\n5.  If the parity changes:\n    *   Check if `currentLength` is greater than `maxLength`. If so, update `maxLength` and reset the counter of max sequences `maxCount=1`.\n    *   If it is equal, just increment the counter `maxCount`.\n    *   Reset `currentLength` to 1.\n6. Handle the last sequence after reading all numbers.\n\n### Answer\n\n**a. Algorithm Description and Justification:**\n\nThe algorithm reads the numbers sequentially, maintaining a count of the current sequence length and the maximum sequence length encountered so far, along with the counter. It compares the parity of the current number with the previous one.  This approach is efficient because it processes the file in a single pass (O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the file). It uses a constant amount of extra memory, regardless of the input size (O(1) space complexity), making it memory-efficient as well.\n\n**b. C++ Code:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream file(\"bac.txt\");\n    int num, prevNum;\n    int currentLength = 0;\n    int maxLength = 0;\n    int maxCount = 0;\n\n    if (file >> prevNum) {\n        currentLength = 1;\n        while (file >> num) {\n            if (num % 2 == prevNum % 2) {\n                currentLength++;\n            } else {\n                if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n                    maxLength = currentLength;\n                    maxCount = 1;\n                } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n                    maxCount++;\n                }\n                currentLength = 1;\n            }\n            prevNum = num;\n        }\n\n        // Handle the last sequence\n        if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n            maxLength = currentLength;\n            maxCount = 1;\n        } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n            maxCount++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    std::cout << maxCount << \" \" << maxLength << std::endl;\n\n    file.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",
    "solutions_anthropicclaude37sonnet_0.8": "# Solutions for Computer Science Exam Exercises\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the logical expression that is equivalent to `x>=3 && x<10`.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe can analyze each option using logical equivalence rules:\n- Option a: `!(x<3 && x>=10)` = `!((x<3) && (x>=10))` = `!(x<3) || !(x>=10)` = `(x>=3) || (x<10)`\n- Option b: `!(x<3 || x>=10)` = `!(x<3) && !(x>=10)` = `(x>=3) && (x<10)`\n- Option c: `x<3 && !(x>=10)` = `(x<3) && (x<10)` = `x<3` (since x<10 is always true if x<3)\n- Option d: `!(x<3) || x>=10` = `(x>=3) || (x>=10)` = `x>=3` (since x>=3 includes all x>=10)\n\n### Answer\nOption b: `!(x<3 || x>=10)` is equivalent to `x>=3 && x<10` because by De Morgan's law, the negation of an OR becomes an AND of negations.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the expression that completes the recursive function `f` so that it returns 1 for prime numbers and 0 otherwise. The function tests divisibility by incrementing y.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe function checks if:\n1. x is even and not 2 (returning 0 for non-prime numbers)\n2. If y² > x, then x has no divisors up to √x, so it's prime (return 1)\n3. If x is divisible by y, then x is not prime (return 0)\n4. Otherwise, we need to continue checking with the next potential divisor\n\n### Answer\nOption a: `y+2` is incorrect as it would skip potential divisors.\nOption b: `y-2` is incorrect as it would decrease y.\nOption c: `y+1` would be the correct answer, but it's not among the options.\nOption d: `y*2` is incorrect as it would skip many potential divisors.\n\nThe correct answer should be `y+1`, but since that's not listed, we can determine that the function must be testing odd divisors only (since even numbers except 2 are handled separately). Therefore, the answer is **a: y+2** to check the next odd number.\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to generate all combinations of 3 distinct fruits from {măr, gutuie, prună, caisă, piersică} where gutuie and piersică don't appear together. We need to find the solution that comes right after (gutuie, prună, caisă).\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's denote the fruits as: 1=măr, 2=gutuie, 3=prună, 4=caisă, 5=piersică.\nThe constraint is that 2 and 5 cannot be together.\n\nLet's list the solutions in lexicographical order:\n1. (1,2,3) - (măr, gutuie, prună)\n2. (1,2,4) - (măr, gutuie, caisă)\n3. (1,3,4) - (măr, prună, caisă)\n4. (1,3,5) - (măr, prună, piersică)\n...\nThe solution (2,3,4) - (gutuie, prună, caisă) will be followed by (2,3,5) - (gutuie, prună, piersică).\n\n### Answer\nOption b: (gutuie, prună, piersică)\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the value of j such that A[20][j] is on the secondary diagonal of a 100×100 matrix.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor a matrix with n rows and n columns (indexed from 0 to n-1), the elements on the secondary diagonal satisfy the equation: row + column = n - 1.\nIn our case, n = 100, so: 20 + j = 100 - 1 => 20 + j = 99 => j = 79\n\n### Answer\nOption c: 79\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a graph with 7 nodes and 8 edges, with 6 known edges. We need to determine the other two edges given that one of the longest elementary paths is 1,2,7,5,4,6.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe known edges are [1,2], [2,4], [2,7], [3,4], [4,5], [4,6].\nLooking at the path 1,2,7,5,4,6, we notice that [5,7] must be one of the missing edges to connect 7 and 5.\nFor the path to be of maximum length, we need to ensure the other edge doesn't create shortcuts in this path.\n\n### Answer\nOption d: [3,6] and [5,7] is correct, as [5,7] is needed for the given path, and [3,6] connects the remaining nodes without creating shortcuts in the longest path.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to trace the execution of the given algorithm, find outputs for specific inputs, and modify the algorithm.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's trace the algorithm step by step for m=21, n=47:\n\n```\nInitial values: m=21, n=47, x=1\n\nLoop 1 (x=1):\n  x=21, y=47, n=46\n  While x≠y:\n    x=21, y=47 → x<y → y=y-x → y=26\n    x=21, y=26 → x<y → y=y-x → y=5\n    x=21, y=5 → x>y → x=x-y → x=16\n    x=16, y=5 → x>y → x=x-y → x=11\n    x=11, y=5 → x>y → x=x-y → x=6\n    x=6, y=5 → x>y → x=x-y → x=1\n    x=1, y=5 → x<y → y=y-x → y=4\n    x=1, y=4 → x<y → y=y-x → y=3\n    x=1, y=3 → x<y → y=y-x → y=2\n    x=1, y=2 → x<y → y=y-x → y=1\n    x=1, y=1 → x=y, exit while loop\n  End of first loop\n\nOutput: n+1 = 46+1 = 47\n```\n\nFor part b, if m=5, we need to find n values that result in output 10.\nFor output to be 10, n+1=10, so n=9.\n\n### Answer\na. The algorithm outputs 47 for inputs m=21 and n=47.\n\nb. If m=5, to get output 10, n must be 9. Another valid value would be n=19, as the algorithm computes the GCD of m and n, then adds 1 to the decremented n.\n\nc. C++ implementation:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int m, n, x = 1;\n    \n    // Read input values\n    cin >> m >> n;\n    \n    while (x == 1) {\n        x = m;\n        int y = n;\n        n = n - 1;\n        \n        while (x != y) {\n            if (x > y)\n                x = x - y;\n            else\n                y = y - x;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    cout << n + 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd.

Looking at the given edges [1,8], [2,3], [2,5], [2,7], [4,5], [5,6], [5,8], [8,9], we need to find a root such that node 5 has exactly two siblings.\n\nIf we choose node 2 as the root, then nodes 3, 5, and 7 would be siblings, but that's three siblings.\nIf we choose node 5 as the root, then nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8 would be children of 5, so no siblings for node 5.\nIf we choose node 8 as the root, then nodes 1, 5, and 9 would be children of 8, so no siblings for node 5.\n\nTo have exactly two siblings for node 5, we need to choose a root where node 5's parent has exactly three children including node 5.\n\n### Answer\nNodes 1 and 9 can be chosen as the root. When either is the root, node 8 becomes the parent of nodes 1, 5, and 9, giving node 5 exactly two siblings.\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write code that outputs a message based on the temperature stored in the struct variable x.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe need to check if the temperature is:\n- Greater than 11°C → \"CALDUROS\"\n- Less than 10°C → \"RACOROS\"\n- Otherwise (10°C or 11°C) → \"NORMAL\"\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nif (x.temperatura > 11)\n    cout << \"CALDUROS\";\nelse if (x.temperatura < 10)\n    cout << \"RACOROS\";\nelse\n    cout << \"NORMAL\";\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a subprogram that replaces the digit at position p in number n with digit x.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Calculate the power of 10 corresponding to position p\n2. Remove the digit at position p from n\n3. Add x multiplied by the power of 10 at position p\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\nvoid schimb(long long& n, int x, int p) {\n    // Calculate 10^p\n    long long power = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++) {\n        power *= 10;\n    }\n    \n    // Remove the digit at position p\n    long long leftPart = (n / (power * 10)) * (power * 10);\n    long long rightPart = n % power;\n    \n    // Insert the new digit x at position p\n    n = leftPart + (x * power) + rightPart;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to create a program that replaces each consonant in a password with its \"friendly vowel\" - the vowel that precedes it in the alphabet with no other vowels in between.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Define the vowels of the English alphabet: a, e, i, o, u\n2. For each letter in the input password:\n   - If it's a vowel, keep it unchanged\n   - If it's a consonant, replace it with its friendly vowel\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool isVowel(char c) {\n    return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';\n}\n\nchar friendlyVowel(char c) {\n    if (c <= 'a') return 'a';\n    else if (c <= 'e') return 'a';\n    else if (c <= 'i') return 'e';\n    else if (c <= 'o') return 'i';\n    else if (c <= 'u') return 'o';\n    else return 'u';\n}\n\nint main() {\n    string password;\n    cin >> password;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < password.length(); i++) {\n        if (!isVowel(password[i])) {\n            // Replace consonant with its friendly vowel\n            password[i] = friendlyVowel(password[i]);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    cout << password;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the maximum length of consecutive numbers with the same parity (all even or all odd) in a sequence, and count how many such sequences of maximum length exist.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read numbers one by one from the file\n2. Keep track of the current sequence length and its parity\n3. When the parity changes or at the end of the file, update the maximum length and count\n4. Return the count of sequences with maximum length and the maximum length\n\n### Algorithm Description\n1. Initialize variables for current sequence length, maximum length, and count of maximum sequences\n2. Read the first number to establish the initial parity\n3. For each subsequent number:\n   - If it has the same parity as the previous number, increment the current sequence length\n   - Otherwise, update maximum length information and reset current sequence with the new parity\n4. After processing all numbers, check if the last sequence affects the result\n5. Return the count and maximum length\n\nThe algorithm is efficient because:\n- It processes each number exactly once (O(n) time complexity)\n- It uses constant extra space regardless of input size (O(1) space complexity)\n- It doesn't need to store the entire sequence in memory\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    \n    int prev, current, currentLength = 1, maxLength = 0, count = 0;\n    \n    // Read first number to establish initial parity\n    fin >> prev;\n    bool prevParity = prev % 2 == 0;\n    \n    // Process remaining numbers\n    while (fin >> current) {\n        bool currentParity = current % 2 == 0;\n        \n        if (currentParity == prevParity) {\n            // Same parity, extend current sequence\n            currentLength++;\n        } else {\n            // Different parity, check if previous sequence is maximal\n            if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n                maxLength = currentLength;\n                count = 1;\n            } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n                count++;\n            }\n            \n            // Start new sequence\n            currentLength = 1;\n            prevParity = currentParity;\n        }\n        \n        prev = current;\n    }\n    \n    // Check the last sequence\n    if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n        maxLength = currentLength;\n        count = 1;\n    } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n        count++;\n    }\n    \n    cout << count << \" \" << maxLength;\n    \n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```"
