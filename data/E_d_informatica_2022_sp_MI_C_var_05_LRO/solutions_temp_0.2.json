This means the expression should be true when `x` is between 3 and 9 inclusive.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe expression `x >= 3 && x < 10` is true for values of `x` from 3 to 9.

    "solutions_gemini20pro_0.2": "Okay, here are the solutions for each exercise, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks for an expression equivalent to `x >= 3 && x < 10`. This expression evaluates to 1 (true) if and only if `x` is greater than or equal to 3 AND less than 10.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe can use De Morgan's laws to find equivalent expressions. De Morgan's laws state:\n1.  `!(A && B)` is equivalent to `!A || !B`\n2.  `!(A || B)` is equivalent to `!A && !B`\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **b. !(x<3 || x>=10)**.\n\nLet's analyze why:\n*   Original expression: `x >= 3 && x < 10`\n*   We want an expression that has the value 1 *if and only if* the original expression has the value 1.\n*   Option b: `!(x < 3 || x >= 10)`\n    *   `x < 3` is the negation of `x >= 3`\n    *   `x >= 10` is the negation of `x < 10`\n    *   The `||` (OR) operator means the inner expression is true if *either* `x < 3` *or* `x >= 10` is true.  This covers all cases *except* when `x` is between 3 and 10 (inclusive of 3, exclusive of 10).\n    *   The outer `!` (NOT) operator inverts the result. So, the entire expression is true only when the inner expression is false, which is precisely when `x >= 3 && x < 10`.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n*   a. `!(x<3 && x>=10)`: The inner expression `x < 3 && x >= 10` is always false, so the negation is always true, regardless of the value of x.\n*   c. `x<3 && !(x>=10)`: This simplifies to `x < 3 && x < 10`, which is equivalent to `x < 3`. This is not equivalent to the original expression.\n*   d. `!(x<3) || x>=10`: This simplifies to `x >= 3 || x >= 10`, which is equivalent to `x >= 3`. This is not equivalent to the original expression.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe function `f(x, y)` is designed to check if `x` is a prime number. It uses a recursive approach. The base cases are:\n1.  If `x` is not 2 and is even, it's not prime (return 0).\n2.  If `y * y > x`, then `x` is prime (return 1). This is because if a number has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than its square root.\n3.  If `x` is divisible by `y`, then `x` is not prime (return 0).\n\nThe recursive step needs to increment `y` to check for the next potential divisor. Since we've already handled even numbers, we only need to check odd divisors.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe recursive call should increment `y` by 2 to check only odd divisors.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **a. y+2**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem describes a backtracking algorithm that generates combinations of three distinct fruits from a set of five fruits: {măr, gutuie, prună, caisă, piersică}. The constraint is that \"gutuie\" (quince) and \"piersică\" (peach) cannot be in the same combination. We are given the first four solutions and need to find the one immediately following (gutuie, prună, caisă).\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe need to follow the backtracking logic, considering the constraint. The order of fruits in the set matters.\n\n1.  The given solutions suggest the algorithm tries to keep earlier elements as long as possible.\n2.  After (gutuie, prună, caisă), we can't have (gutuie, prună, piersică) due to the constraint.\n3.  Since 'gutuie' is fixed in the first position, and we've exhausted combinations with 'prună' in the second, we must increment the second element. The next fruit after 'prună' is 'caisă'.\n4.  With (gutuie, caisă, ...), the next available fruit is 'măr', but this would go before the given solution in lexicographical order. The next available fruit is 'prună', but this would also go before the given solution. The next fruit is 'piersică', but this is not allowed.\n5.  Therefore, we must increment the first element. The next fruit after 'gutuie' is 'prună'.\n6.  The next combination will start with 'măr'.\n7.  Following the given order, we try to fill the remaining positions. The next solution is (măr, caisă, piersică).\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is **c. (mar, caisă, piersică)**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a 100x100 2D array `A`. We need to find the column index `j` such that `A[20][j]` lies on the secondary diagonal.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe secondary diagonal of a square matrix has the property that the sum of the row and column indices is constant and equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of rows (or columns). In this case, `n = 100`.  So, for any element `A[i][j]` on the secondary diagonal, `i + j = 99`.\n\n### Answer\nWe are given `i = 20`.  Therefore, `20 + j = 99`, which means `j = 99 - 20 = 79`. The correct answer is **c. 79**.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given an undirected graph with 7 nodes and 8 edges. Six edges are provided, and we are given a longest elementary chain (path): 1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6. We need to identify the remaining two edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Draw the graph based on the given six edges and the longest chain.\n2.  Analyze the given chain.  It visits all nodes.\n3.  Consider the remaining possible edges and see which pair, when added, doesn't create cycles shorter than the given longest chain and connects the graph.\n\n### Answer\nLet's analyze the options:\n*   a. [1,4] and [4,7]: Adding [1,4] creates a cycle 1-2-4-1. Adding [4,7] creates a cycle 2-4-7-2.\n*   b. [1,4] and [5,7]: Adding [1,4] creates a cycle 1-2-4-1. Adding [5,7] creates a cycle 2-7-5-4-2.\n*   c. [2,5] and [4,7]: Adding [2,5] creates a cycle 2-4-5-2. Adding [4,7] creates a cycle 2-4-7-2.\n*   d. [3,6] and [5,7]: Adding [3,6] does not create a short cycle. Adding [5,7] creates a cycle 2-5-7-2. However, if we add [1,3] and [1,7] we get a complete graph.\n\nDrawing the graph with the six given edges, we see nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are connected. Node 3 is connected to 4.\nThe longest path given uses all nodes.\nIf we add [3,6], we connect node 3 to the main component. If we add [5,7] we create a cycle.\nIf we add [1,3] and [1,7] we create a complete graph.\n\nThe chain 1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6 has length 5.\nIf we add [3,6] and [1,3], the longest chain is 1,3,4,5,6,2,7.\nIf we add [3,6] and [5,7], the longest chain is 1,2,7,5,4,6,3.\n\nThe correct edges are [3,6] and [1,3]. However, none of the options provide this.\nThe best option, given the constraints, is to connect 3 to the rest of the graph. The longest chain is 1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6.\nIf we add [3,6], we can have a longer chain.\nIf we add [1,3] we can have a longer chain.\n\nThe provided options are all incorrect. However, among the given options, **d. [3,6] and [5,7]** is the *least incorrect*, as it at least connects node 3 to the rest of the graph, although it does create a cycle. The question states *could* be, so we are looking for a plausible, if not perfect, answer.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `m` and `n` in each iteration of the outer loop. The outer loop decrements `n` in each iteration. The algorithm prints `n + 1` after the outer loop finishes.\n\n### Solution Approach\na. Trace the algorithm with `m = 21` and `n = 47`.\nb. Find two values of `n` (with `m = 5`) such that the final printed value is 11.\nc. Translate the pseudocode to C++.\nd. Rewrite the algorithm using a \"do-while\" loop instead of the first \"while\" loop.\n\n### Answer\n**a.**\nInitial values: m = 21, n = 47, x = 1\nLoop 1:\nx = 21, y = 47, n = 46\nGCD(21, 47) = 1. x becomes 1.\nLoop 2:\nx = 21, y = 46, n = 45\nGCD(21, 46) = 1. x becomes 1.\n...This continues until n becomes smaller than m.\nLoop 27: x=21, y=21, n=20. GCD(21,21)=21. x becomes 21.\nThe loop terminates.\nOutput: n + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21\n\n**b.**\nThe algorithm prints `n + 1`. We want this to be 11, so the final value of `n` should be 10. The outer loop continues as long as `x` is 1.  `x` becomes 1 if `GCD(m, n) = 1`.  Since `m = 5`, we need to find two values of `n` greater than 5 that are coprime with 5 and, when decremented, eventually reach 10.\n*   If n = 11, the sequence of n is 11, 10. GCD(5,11) = 1. n becomes 10.\n*   If n = 16, the sequence of n is 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10. GCD(5,16)=1, GCD(5,15)=5, GCD(5,14)=1, GCD(5,13)=1, GCD(5,12)=1, GCD(5,11)=1, GCD(5,10)=5.\n\nSo, two possible values for `n` are 11 and 16.\n\n**c.**\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int m, n, x, y;\n    std::cin >> m >> n;\n    x = 1;\n    while (x == 1) {\n        x = m;\n        y = n;\n        n = n - 1;\n        while (x != y) {\n            if (x > y) {\n                x = x - y;\n            } else {\n                y = y - x;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    std::cout << n + 1 << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**d.**\n```pseudocode\nciteşte m,n\n (numere naturale nenule, m<n)\n x1\n repetă\n  xm; yn; nn-1\n  cât timp x≠y execută\n    dacă x>y atunci xx-y\n    altfel yy-x\n  sfârșit cât timp\n până când x!=1\nscrie n+1\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe are given an undirected tree with 9 nodes and a list of edges. We need to find two possible roots such that node 5 has two siblings.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Draw the tree based on the given edges.\n2.  A node has siblings if they share the same parent.\n3.  If node 5 has two siblings, it must have a parent, and that parent must have three children (node 5 and its two siblings).\n4.  Iterate through possible roots and check the number of children of node 5's parent.\n\n### Answer\nDrawing the tree:\n\n```\n    1--8--9\n       |\n       5--4\n       | \\\n       6  2--3\n          |\n          7\n```\n\n*   If 8 is the root, 5's parent is 8, and 8's children are 1, 5, and 9.  So, 5 has siblings 1 and 9 (two siblings).\n*   If 2 is the root, 5's parent is 2, and 2's children are 3, 5, and 7. So, 5 has siblings 3 and 7 (two siblings).\n* If 5 is the root, then 5 has no siblings.\n\nTwo possible roots are 8 and 2.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a `struct meteo` that stores the year and temperature. We need to print \"CALDUROS\" if the temperature is greater than 11, \"RACOROS\" if it's less than 10, and \"NORMAL\" otherwise.\n\n### Solution Approach\nUse `if-else if-else` statements to check the temperature and print the corresponding message.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nstruct meteo {\n    int an;\n    int temperatura;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    meteo x;\n    x.an = 2023;       // Example values\n    x.temperatura = 10.5; // Example values\n\n    if (x.temperatura > 11) {\n        std::cout << \"CALDUROS\" << std::endl;\n    } else if (x.temperatura < 10) {\n        std::cout << \"RACOROS\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"NORMAL\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe `schimb` function takes an integer `n`, a digit `x`, and a position `p`.

Keep track of the number of maximum-length sequences (`countMaxLength`).\n5.  If the current number has the same parity as the previous number, increment `currentLength`.\n6.  If the current number has a different parity or it's the end of the file:\n    *   If `currentLength` is greater than `maxLength`, update `maxLength` and reset `countMaxLength` to 1.\n    *   If `currentLength` is equal to `maxLength`, increment `countMaxLength`.\n    *   Reset `currentLength` to 1.\n\n### Answer\n**a. Algorithm Description:**\n\nThe algorithm reads the numbers from the file sequentially. It maintains three variables: `currentLength` (length of the current sequence of numbers with the same parity), `maxLength` (length of the longest sequence found so far), and `countMaxLength` (number of sequences with length equal to `maxLength`).  It iterates through the numbers, comparing the parity of the current number with the previous one. If the parities are the same, it increments `currentLength`. If the parities are different, it checks if `currentLength` is greater than or equal to `maxLength`. If it's greater, `maxLength` is updated, and `countMaxLength` is reset to 1. If it's equal, `countMaxLength` is incremented.  `currentLength` is then reset to 1 to start counting a new sequence. This approach is efficient because it reads the file only once (O(n) time complexity) and uses a constant amount of extra memory (O(1) space complexity).\n\n**b. C++ Code:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream fin(\"bac.txt\");\n    int currentLength = 0;\n    int maxLength = 0;\n    int countMaxLength = 0;\n    int previousNumber, currentNumber;\n\n    if (fin >> previousNumber) {\n        currentLength = 1;\n        while (fin >> currentNumber) {\n            if (currentNumber % 2 == previousNumber % 2) {\n                currentLength++;\n            } else {\n                if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n                    maxLength = currentLength;\n                    countMaxLength = 1;\n                } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n                    countMaxLength++;\n                }\n                currentLength = 1;\n            }\n            previousNumber = currentNumber;\n        }\n\n        // Check the last sequence\n        if (currentLength > maxLength) {\n            maxLength = currentLength;\n            countMaxLength = 1;\n        } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {\n            countMaxLength++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    fin.close();\n    std::cout << countMaxLength << \" \" << maxLength << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

Looking at the existing code:\n- It returns 0 if x is even (except 2)\n- It returns 1 if y² > x (meaning we've checked all possible divisors)\n- It returns 0 if y divides x (meaning x is not prime)\n- Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the next value to check\n\nFor the recursion to work correctly, we need to increment y to check the next potential divisor.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is a. `y+2`\n\nThis works because:\n- For odd numbers, we only need to check odd divisors (since we already checked divisibility by 2)\n- Starting from y=3, we check y=5, y=7, etc. until y² > x\n- This is more efficient than checking every number (y+1)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the solution generated immediately after (gutuie, prună, caisă) in a backtracking algorithm that generates all possible combinations of 3 distinct fruits from {măr, gutuie, prună, caisă, piersică}, with the constraint that gutuie and piersică cannot be on the same platter.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's assign numbers to the fruits for clarity:\n1. măr\n2. gutuie\n3. prună\n4. caisă\n5. piersică\n\nThe constraint is that 2 (gutuie) and 5 (piersică) cannot appear together.\n\nThe first four solutions are:\n- (1,2,3) = (măr, gutuie, prună)\n- (1,2,4) = (măr, gutuie, caisă)\n- (1,3,4) = (măr, prună, caisă)\n- (1,3,5) = (măr, prună, piersică)\n\nWe need to find what comes after (2,3,4) = (gutuie, prună, caisă).\n\nFollowing the backtracking pattern, the next solution would be (2,3,5), but this violates our constraint since gutuie and piersică cannot be together. So we move to the next valid combination, which is (2,4,5) = (gutuie, caisă, piersică), but this also violates the constraint.\n\nThe next valid combination would be (3,4,5) = (prună, caisă, piersică).\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is d. (prună, caisă, piersică)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 4\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the value of j such that A[20][j] is on the secondary diagonal of a 100×100 matrix (indexed from 0 to 99).\n\n### Solution Approach\nFor a matrix with n rows and n columns (indexed from 0 to n-1), the elements on the secondary diagonal have the property that row + column = n - 1.\n\nIn our case, n = 100, so for any element on the secondary diagonal: row + column = 99\n\nGiven that row = 20, we need to find j (column) such that:\n20 + j = 99\n\n### Answer\nj = 99 - 20 = 79\n\nThe correct answer is c. 79\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have a graph with 7 nodes and 8 edges. Six edges are known: [1,2], [2,4], [2,7], [3,4], [4,5], [4,6]. We also know that one of the longest elementary paths is 1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6. We need to determine the other two edges.\n\n### Solution Approach\nFirst, let's analyze the given path: 1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6\nThis path uses the edges [1,2], [2,7], [7,5], [5,4], [4,6].\n\nAmong these, [7,5] is not in our list of known edges, so this must be one of the missing edges.\n\nThe other missing edge must connect nodes that allow this path to be one of the longest. Looking at the options and considering the structure of the graph:\n- [1,4] would create a shorter path from 1 to 4\n- [4,7] would create a shorter path from 4 to 7\n- [2,5] would create a shorter path from 2 to 5\n- [3,6] doesn't affect the given path\n- [5,7] is already identified as one of the missing edges\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is d. [3,6] și [5,7]\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to analyze the given algorithm, determine its output for specific inputs, find inputs that produce a specific output, convert it to C++, and rewrite it with a different loop structure.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's trace the algorithm step by step:\n1. Read m and n (m < n)\n2. Set x = 1\n3. While x = 1:\n   - Set x = m, y = n, n = n-1\n   - While x ≠ y:\n     - If x > y then x = x-y\n     - Else y = y-x\n4. Output n+1\n\nThis algorithm repeatedly finds the GCD of m and n, decrements n, and continues until the GCD is not 1.\n\n### Answer\na. For m=21 and n=47:\n   - First iteration: x=21, y=47, n=46\n     - GCD(21,47) = 1, so x becomes 1\n   - Second iteration: x=21, y=46, n=45\n     - GCD(21,46) = 1, so x becomes 1\n   - This continues until n=42\n   - For x=21, y=42, n=41\n     - GCD(21,42) = 21, so x becomes 21\n   - Loop ends\n   - Output: 41+1 = 42\n\nb. For m=5, to get output 10, we need n=9 or n=14:\n   - For n=9: After iterations, n becomes 9, and GCD(5,9)=1, so we continue until n=5, and GCD(5,5)=5, so output is 5+1=6 (not 10)\n   - For n=14: After iterations, n becomes 9, and GCD(5,9)=1, so we continue until n=9, and output is 9+1=10\n   - For n=19: Similar process leads to output 10\n\nc. C++ program:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int m, n, x, y;\n    cin >> m >> n;\n    x = 1;\n    while (x == 1) {\n        x = m;\n        y = n;\n        n = n - 1;\n        while (x != y) {\n            if (x > y)\n                x = x - y;\n            else\n                y = y - x;\n        }\n    }\n    cout << n + 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd.

We need to find two possible root nodes such that node 5 has exactly two \"siblings\" (nodes that share the same parent).\n\n### Solution Approach\nFirst, let's identify the structure of the tree based on the given edges:\n[1,8], [2,3], [2,5], [2,7], [4,5], [5,6], [5,8], [8,9]\n\nIf we choose node 2 as the root:\n- Node 2 has children: 3, 5, 7\n- Node 5 has children: 4, 6, 8\n- Node 8 has children: 1, 9\n\nIf we choose node 8 as the root:\n- Node 8 has children: 1, 5, 9\n- Node 5 has children: 2, 4, 6\n- Node 2 has children: 3, 7\n\nFor node 5 to have exactly two siblings, its parent must have exactly three children including node 5.\n\n### Answer\nTwo possible root nodes are 4 and 6.\n\nIf node 4 is the root:\n- Node 4 has child: 5\n- Node 5 has children: 2, 6, 8\n- Node 2 has children: 3, 7\n- Node 8 has children: 1, 9\n\nHere, node 5 has no siblings.\n\nIf node 6 is the root:\n- Node 6 has child: 5\n- Node 5 has children: 2, 4, 8\n- Node 2 has children: 3, 7\n- Node 8 has children: 1, 9\n\nHere, node 5 has no siblings.\n\nIf node 1 is the root:\n- Node 1 has child: 8\n- Node 8 has children: 5, 9\n- Node 5 has children: 2, 4, 6\n- Node 2 has children: 3, 7\n\nHere, node 5 has one sibling (node 9).\n\nIf node 9 is the root:\n- Node 9 has child: 8\n- Node 8 has children: 1, 5\n- Node 5 has children: 2, 4, 6\n- Node 2 has children: 3, 7\n\nHere, node 5 has one sibling (node 1).\n\nIf node 3 is the root:\n- Node 3 has child: 2\n- Node 2 has children: 5, 7\n- Node 5 has children: 4, 6, 8\n- Node 8 has children: 1, 9\n\nHere, node 5 has one sibling (node 7).\n\nIf node 7 is the root:\n- Node 7 has child: 2\n- Node 2 has children: 3, 5\n- Node 5 has children: 4, 6, 8\n- Node 8 has children: 1, 9\n\nHere, node 5 has one sibling (node 3).\n\nTherefore, the two nodes that can be chosen as roots so that node 5 has exactly two siblings are nodes 3 and 7.\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write code that displays a message based on the temperature stored in the `x` structure.\n\n### Solution Approach\nWe'll check the temperature value and display the appropriate message:\n- If temperature > 11°C: \"CALDUROS\"\n- If temperature < 10°C: \"RACOROS\"\n- Otherwise (10°C or 11°C): \"NORMAL\"\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nif (x.temperatura > 11)\n    cout << \"CALDUROS\";\nelse if (x.temperatura < 10)\n    cout << \"RACOROS\";\nelse\n    cout << \"NORMAL\";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to implement a function `schimb` that replaces the digit at position `p` in number `n` with the digit `x`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Calculate the power of 10 corresponding to position p: 10^p\n2. Remove the digit at position p: n - (n / 10^p % 10) * 10^p\n3.

Define the vowels of the English alphabet: a, e, i, o, u\n2. For each consonant in the password, find its friendly vowel:\n   - Iterate through the alphabet until we find the consonant\n   - Keep track of the last vowel encountered\n   - Replace the consonant with this vowel\n3. Leave vowels unchanged\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    char password[51];\n    char encoded[51];\n    cin >> password;\n    \n    int len = strlen(password);\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char c = password[i];\n        \n        if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {\n            // If it's a vowel, keep it unchanged\n            encoded[i] = c;\n        } else {\n            // If it's a consonant, find its friendly vowel\n            char friendlyVowel = 'a';\n            \n            if (c > 'a' && c < 'e') friendlyVowel = 'a';\n            else if (c > 'e' && c < 'i') friendlyVowel = 'e';\n            else if (c > 'i' && c < 'o') friendlyVowel = 'i';\n            else if (c > 'o' && c < 'u') friendlyVowel = 'o';\n            else if (c > 'u') friendlyVowel = 'u';\n            \n            encoded[i] = friendlyVowel;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    encoded[len] = '\\0';\n    cout << encoded;\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to find the maximum length of parity sequences (consecutive numbers with the same parity) in a file and count how many such sequences exist.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Read numbers one by one from the file\n2. Keep track of the current sequence length and parity\n3. When the parity changes, update the maximum length if needed\n4. Count sequences that have the maximum length\n\n### Answer\na. Algorithm description:\n1. Initialize variables for current sequence length, maximum sequence length, and count of maximum sequences\n2. Read the first number and determine its parity\n3. For each subsequent number:\n   - If it has the same parity as the previous number, increment current sequence length\n   - Otherwise, check if current sequence length equals the maximum:\n     - If greater, update maximum and set count to 1\n     - If equal, increment count\n     - Reset current sequence length to 1 and update current parity\n4. Check the last sequence after the loop ends\n5. Output the count and maximum length\n\nThis algorithm is efficient because:\n- It processes each number exactly once (O(n) time complexity)\n- It uses constant extra space (O(1) space complexity)\n- It doesn't need to store the entire sequence in memory\n\nb.
