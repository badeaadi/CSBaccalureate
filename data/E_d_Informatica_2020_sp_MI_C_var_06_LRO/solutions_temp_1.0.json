    "solutions_gemini20pro_1.0": "Okay, here are the solutions for each exercise, following the requested format:\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 1\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks to evaluate a simple C/C++ expression involving integer and floating-point arithmetic. The key is to remember operator precedence and implicit type conversions.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Division has higher precedence than addition.\n2.  `5.0 / 2` is evaluated first. Since `5.0` is a floating-point number, the result will also be a floating-point number: `2.5`.\n3.  The expression becomes `3 + 2.5 + 2`.\n4.  The integer `3` is converted to `3.0`, and integer `2` is also promoted to a `double`, and the additions are performed: `3.0 + 2.5 + 2.0 = 7.5`.\n\n### Answer\nd. 7.5\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis exercise involves understanding recursion and how array elements are modified within a recursive function. We need to determine the initial array values that, after the recursive calls, will produce the output \"2020\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. Analyze the function `f`. The function modifies the array `v` recursively.  The base case is `i >= 3`. In the base case, `v[i]` is incremented.\n2. Trace the execution with the output \"2020\" in mind.  Since the output prints `v[i]` *after* the recursive call, the output order is reversed relative to the modification order. This means `v[0]` is printed last, `v[1]` second to last, etc. Therefore the expected final values of the array are v[0] = 2, v[1] = 0, v[2] = 2, v[3] = 0.\n3. Work backwards from the base case (`i=3`) to determine the required initial values.\n    *   `i = 3`: `v[3]` is incremented: to get a final v[3] = 0, the initial value has to be -1.\n    *   `i = 2`: `v[2]` is *not* incremented (since the `if` condition is `i>=3`): to get a final v[2] = 2, the initial value needs to be 2.\n    *   `i = 1`: `v[1]` is *not* incremented: To get v[1] = 0, the initial value has to be 0.\n    *   `i = 0`: `v[0]` is *not* incremented: To get v[0] = 2, the initial value has to be 2.\n4. Combine the initial values in order: 2, 0, 2, -1.\n\n### Answer\nNone of the offered solutions provides the right result.\nThe needed result should be 2, 0, 2, -1.\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed for this exercise)\n---\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThis exercise tests the understanding of the backtracking method. We're given a set of constraints and need to find the sixth solution generated by the backtracking algorithm.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Understand the constraints:\n    *   Four people pay a total of 200.\n    *   Each payment is a multiple of 10 and non-zero.\n    *   Payments are in strictly decreasing order: p1 > p2 > p3 > p4.\n2.

A leaf node is a node with no children.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Understand the \"parent vector\" representation. The value at index `i` in the vector represents the parent of node `i+1`. A value of `0` indicates the root node (no parent).\n2.  Iterate through the parent vector.\n3.  For each node (from 1 to 10), check if it appears as a parent in the vector.\n4.  If a node *does not* appear in the parent vector (excluding the 0, which represents the root's \"parent\"), it's a leaf node.\n5.  Count the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Answer\nc. 5\n\n### Code Solution (Not needed, but here is how to derive the result):\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<int> parents = {7, 5, 6, 5, 7, 0, 6, 3, 3, 8};\n    int num_nodes = parents.size();\n    int leaf_count = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= num_nodes; ++i) {\n        bool found = false;\n        for (int j = 0; j < num_nodes; ++j) {\n            if (parents[j] == i) {\n                found = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!found) {\n            leaf_count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"Number of leaf nodes: \" << leaf_count << std::endl; // Output: 5\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n---\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n\n### Problem Analysis\nGiven the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph, the task asks for the number of connected partial graphs that are different from the original graph.  A partial graph is formed by removing edges. It must also remain connected.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\n1.  **Understand the graph:** Draw the graph represented by the adjacency matrix.\n    ```\n       1----2\n       |    |\n       4----3\n       |\n       5\n    ```\n2.  **Identify essential edges:** An edge is essential if removing it disconnects the graph.\n3.  **Count connected partial graphs:** The original graph has edges: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (3,4).\n    - The edge (1,5) can be removed without disconnecting the graph, so the graph without (1,5) it's a possible solution.\n    - Removing (1,2) will disconnect 2 and 3.\n    - Removing (1,4) will disconnect 4 and 3.\n    - Removing (2,3) will disconnect 2 and 1.\n    - Removing (3,4) will disconnect 4 and 1.\n    - The graph has a cycle (1, 2, 3, 4, 1). We can remove any one of the edges in the cycle and keep it connected. This gives us 4 options.\n    We also can remove the edge between 1 and 5.\n4. List the possible removals of edges such as to have connected graphs.\n        - Remove (1,5)\n        - Remove (1,2)\n        - Remove (1,4)\n        - Remove (2,3)\n        - Remove (3,4)\nThere are 4 other partial connected graphs, derived by removing exactly 1 edge from the main cycle, + 1 graph removing edge (1,5)\n\n### Answer\na. 4+1 = 5 is not correct.\n\nLet's analyze more careful. The graph has a cycle (1-2-3-4-1).\n1. If we remove the edge 1-5. The graph remain connected.\n2. If we remove ONLY one edge from cycle: (1-2) OR (2-3) OR (3-4) OR (4-1) . There are 4 options.\n3. Removing two edges must not disconnect the graph.\nWe can remove (1-2) and (3-4)\nWe can remove (2-3) and (1-4)\n4. We can not remove 3 edges from cycle\n5. We cannot remove the cycle.\n\nThe total connected subgraphs different that the graph are 1 + 4 = 5. But the given graph it is one of the graph.\nWe have a cycle.\n1-2\n| |\n4-3\nand\n1-5\n\nRemove 1 edge:\n1. Remove 1-5. => connected.\n2. Remove 1-2. => connected.\n3. Remove 2-3. => connected.\n4. Remove 3-4. => connected.\n5. Remove 4-1. => connected.\n\nRemove 2 edges:\n1. Remove 1-5 and 1-2 => connected\n2. Remove 1-5 and 2-3 => connected\n3. Remove 1-5 and 3-4 => connected\n4.

Return the final sum.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nint suma(int a, int b) {\n    int smaller = (a < b) ? a : b;\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= smaller; ++i) {\n        if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {\n            sum += i;\n        }\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n```\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint suma(int a, int b) {\n    int smaller = (a < b) ? a : b;\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= smaller; ++i) {\n        if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {\n            sum += i;\n        }\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Example usage\n    int a = 20, b = 12;\n    int result = suma(a, b);\n    cout << \"Sum of common divisors of \" << a << \" and \" << b << \" is: \" << result << endl; // Output: 7\n\n    a=12; b=12;\n    cout << suma(a,b) << endl; // 1+2+3+4+6+12 = 28\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 2\n\n### Problem Analysis\nRead a text, rotate each word with at least three letters to the left (first letter becomes the last), and print the modified text. If no such words exist, print \"nu exista\".\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  Read the input text.\n2.  Iterate through the text word by word (using spaces as delimiters).\n3.  For each word:\n    *   Check its length.\n    *   If the length is less than 3, append it to the result string as is.\n    *   If the length is 3 or more, perform the rotation:\n        *   Store the first character.\n        *   Shift all other characters one position to the left.\n        *   Place the stored first character at the end.\n        *  Append rotated word to the result string.\n    * Append a space to the output\n4.

The program should be efficient.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.  **Efficiency:** Reading all numbers into an array and then trying all permutations would be extremely inefficient (O(n!)).  A palindrome has a specific property: at most one number can appear an odd number of times.\n2.  **Frequency Counting:** Use a hash table (or an array if the range of numbers is small) to count the frequency of each number.\n3.  **Palindrome Check:** Iterate through the frequencies.  Count how many numbers have odd frequencies.  If this count is greater than 1, it's not possible to form a palindrome.\n4. Output the message\n\n### Answer\na.  **Algorithm Description and Justification:**\n    The algorithm reads the numbers from the file one by one. Instead of storing all numbers, which would require a large amount of memory for large inputs, it uses a frequency array (or hash map) to count the occurrences of each number.  This significantly reduces memory usage. After counting the frequencies, it checks how many numbers have odd frequencies.  A sequence can form a palindrome if and only if at most one number appears an odd number of times.  This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input, because it iterates through the input once to count frequencies and then iterates through the frequency array (which has a size limited by the range of possible input values), and the space complexity is O(k) being k the number of distincts numbers, which is better than saving all input into an array.\n\nb. See Code below.\n\n### Code Solution\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <unordered_map>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream fin(\"bac.in\");\n    if (!fin.is_open())\n    {\n        cerr << \"error opening file\";\n        return 1;\n    }\n    unordered_map<int, int> frequencies;\n    int num;\n\n    while (fin >> num) {\n        frequencies[num]++;\n    }\n\n    fin.close();\n\n    int odd_count = 0;\n    for (auto const& [key, val] : frequencies) {\n        if (val % 2 != 0) {\n            odd_count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (odd_count <= 1) {\n        cout << \"DA\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"NU\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n",

Division has higher precedence than addition\n2. Operations with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right\n3. 5.0 indicates a floating-point value\n\n### Answer\n3+5.0/2+2 = 3+2.5+2 = 7.5\n\nTherefore, the answer is **d. 7.5**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to determine the initial values of array v such that the recursive function f, when called with f(0,v), displays 2020.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLet's trace the function's execution:\n1. f(0,v) calls f(1,v)\n2. f(1,v) calls f(2,v)\n3. f(2,v) calls f(3,v)\n4. f(3,v) modifies v[3] = v[3] + 1 and prints v[3]\n5. Returning to f(2,v), it prints v[2]\n6. Returning to f(1,v), it prints v[1]\n7. Returning to f(0,v), it prints v[0]\n\nSo the output is: v[3] v[2] v[1] v[0]\n\n### Answer\nFor the output to be 2020, we need:\n- v[3] (after incrementing) = 2\n- v[2] = 0\n- v[1] = 2\n- v[0] = 0\n\nTherefore, initially v[3] = 1 (since it gets incremented)\nThe array must be: 0, 2, 0, 1\n\nThe correct answer is **b. 0,2,0,1**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nUsing backtracking, we're generating all ways four people can pay a 200 lei bill with these constraints:\n- Each person pays a non-zero amount divisible by 10\n- First person pays more than second, second more than third, third more than fourth\n- We need to identify the 6th solution in the generated sequence\n\n### Solution Approach\nGiven the first four solutions:\n1. (70, 60, 40, 30)\n2. (70, 60, 50, 20)\n3. (80, 50, 40, 30)\n4. (80, 60, 40, 20)\n\nWe need to determine the pattern of generation and continue it to find the 6th solution.\n\nThe pattern appears to be ordered by:\n1. First amount (ascending)\n2. Second amount (ascending)\n3. Third amount (ascending)\n4. Fourth amount (calculated to make sum 200)\n\n### Answer\nThe 5th solution would be (80, 60, 50, 10)\nThe 6th solution would be (80, 70, 30, 20)\n\nTherefore, the answer is **c.

We need to find the number of leaf nodes.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. In a tree, leaf nodes are those that have no children\n2. To identify leaf nodes, we need to check which nodes never appear as parents in the vector\n3. Node at index i has parent value of vector[i] (with indices starting from 0)\n\n### Answer\nFirst, let's identify each node's parent:\n- Node 1 has parent 7\n- Node 2 has parent 5\n- Node 3 has parent 6\n- Node 4 has parent 5\n- Node 5 has parent 7\n- Node 6 has parent 0 (root)\n- Node 7 has parent 6\n- Node 8 has parent 3\n- Node 9 has parent 3\n- Node 10 has parent 8\n\nNow, let's identify which nodes appear as parents:\nParents: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nTherefore, nodes that are not parents are leaf nodes: 1, 2, 4, 9, 10\nCount of leaf nodes = 5\n\nThe correct answer is **c. 5**\n\n---\n\n## Subject I - Exercise 5\n### Problem Analysis\nWe have an undirected graph with 5 nodes represented by an adjacency matrix. We need to count the number of connected partial graphs that are different from the original graph.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. First, understand the structure of the original graph from the adjacency matrix\n2. A partial graph has the same set of vertices but a subset of edges\n3. We need to count how many connected partial graphs exist (excluding the original graph)\n\n### Answer\nThe adjacency matrix shows the following edges:\n(1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (3,4)\n\nThe original graph has 5 edges and is connected.\nTotal possible partial graphs = 2^5 = 32 (as each edge can be included or excluded)\n\nAmong these:\n- 1 is the original graph\n- 1 is the empty graph (no edges)\n- Some don't maintain connectivity\n\nAfter analyzing all possible combinations, we find 30 connected partial graphs that are different from the original.\n\nThe correct answer is **d. 30**\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nThis algorithm processes a natural number and checks for the presence of certain digits.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe algorithm:\n1.

For c = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8:\n   - Checks if digit c appears in a\n   - Prints 1 if it appears, 0 otherwise\n\n### Answer\na) For a = 240107:\n   - c = 0: 0 appears in 240107, prints 1\n   - c = 2: 2 appears in 240107, prints 1\n   - c = 4: 4 appears in 240107, prints 1\n   - c = 6: 6 doesn't appear in 240107, prints 0\n   - c = 8: 8 doesn't appear in 240107, prints 0\n   So the output is: 1 1 1 0 0\n\nb) For a number to have all non-zero outputs, it must contain all even digits (0,2,4,6,8).\n   - Smallest such number in [10^5, 10^6): 102468\n   - Largest such number in [10^5, 10^6): 986420\n\nc) C++ program:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int a, c = 0, b, x;\n    cin >> a;\n    \n    do {\n        b = a;\n        x = 0;\n        \n        do {\n            if (b % 10 == c) {\n                x = 1;\n            }\n            b = b / 10;\n        } while (b != 0 && x != 1);\n        \n        cout << x << \" \";\n        c += 2;\n    } while (c <= 9);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nd) Equivalent algorithm with a different loop structure:\n```\ncitește a (număr natural)\nc←0\nrepetă\n    b←a; x←0\n    cât timp b>0 și x=0 execută\n        dacă b%10=c atunci\n            x←1\n        b←[b/10]\n    scrie x,' '\n    c←c+2\npână când c>9\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 2\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to define a structure for storing computer information including monitor type and memory capacities.\n\n### Solution Approach\nThe structure should have fields that match the expressions shown: c.monitor, c.memorie.interna, and c.memorie.externa.\n\n### Answer\n```cpp\nstruct memorie {\n    int interna;\n    int externa;\n};\n\nstruct calculator {\n    char monitor;\n    struct memorie memorie;\n};\n\ncalculator c;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject II - Exercise 3\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to complete a nested loop to create a 9x9 array with a specific pattern of '>' and '<' symbols, starting with all '=' symbols.\n\n### Solution Approach\nLooking at the desired output pattern:\n- The top 5 rows are filled with '>'\n- In the bottom 4 rows, the pattern changes to include some '<' symbols\n- The pattern seems to form a transition boundary\n\n### Answer\nThe completed loop would be:\n```cpp\nfor(i=0;i<9;i++)\n    for(j=0;j<9;j++)\n        if(i>=5 && j>=9-i)\n            a[i][j]='<';\n        else\n            a[i][j]='>';\n```\n\n---\n\n## Subject III - Exercise 1\n### Problem Analysis\nWe need to write a function that returns the sum of common divisors of two natural numbers.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1.
